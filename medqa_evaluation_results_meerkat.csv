The laboratory results show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The combination of fever, rash, and arthralgias in a patient who recently traveled to an endemic area is suggestive of a viral hemorrhagic fever. Among the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is Dengue fever, which is endemic in Vietnam and Cambodia and is characterized by these symptoms. The tourniquet test is used to diagnose dengue fever by detecting IgG antibodies against the dengue virus, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis as the clinical presentation is sufficient.",A,True
"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?","{'A': 'Aldosterone excess', 'B': 'Catecholamine-secreting mass', 'C': 'Cortisol excess', 'D': 'Impaired kidney perfusion', 'E': 'Increased peripheral vascular resistance'}",A,"The patient's laboratory values show a serum potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L, which is low (hypokalemia). Hypokalemia can be associated with conditions that cause a loss of potassium from the body or shift potassium into cells. One such condition is primary hyperaldosteronism, which is characterized by excess production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to excrete potassium, leading to hypokalemia. The patient's hypertension and hypokalemia are consistent with the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism (aldosterone excess). Therefore, the answer is A) Aldosterone excess.",A,True
"A 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?","{'A': 'Clear cell adenocarcinoma', 'B': 'Melanoma', 'C': 'Botryoid sarcoma', 'D': 'Verrucous carcinoma', 'E': 'Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)'}",A,"The patient's history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero is associated with an increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. The presentation of postcoital bleeding and intermenstrual discharge, along with the finding of a polypoid mass on the anterior vaginal wall, is consistent with a diagnosis of vaginal cancer. Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most likely malignant tumor is clear cell adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the answer is A) Clear cell adenocarcinoma.",A,True
"A 36-year-old man undergoes open reduction and internal fixation of a left femur fracture sustained after a motor vehicle collision. Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?","{'A': 'Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin', 'B': 'Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane', 'C': 'Ability to cleave β-lactam rings', 'D': 'Development of efflux pumps', 'E': 'Adaptation in binding proteins'}",E,"The patient's symptoms of fever, redness around the surgical site, and purulent discharge suggest a postoperative wound infection. The wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which are typically Staphylococcus species. Dicloxacillin is a β-lactam antibiotic, which is effective against Staphylococcus infections unless the bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms.

The failure to improve with antibiotic therapy could be due to the development of resistance in the bacteria. One common mechanism of resistance against β-lactam antibiotics is the production of β-lactamase enzymes, which can cleave the β-lactam ring and inactivate the antibiotic. This would render the antibiotic ineffective.

Therefore, the most appropriate option is C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.",D,False
"A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with a history of black, tarry stools but denies vomiting of blood or abdominal pain. His family has noticed progressive confusion. History is significant for liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. His heart rate is 112/min, temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, he is jaundiced, lethargic, is oriented to person and place but not date, and has moderate ascites. Neurological examination reveals asterixis, and his stool is guaiac-positive. Liver function test are shown below:
Total albumin 2 g/dL
Prothrombin time 9 seconds
Total bilirubin 5 mg/dL
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 100 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 220 U/L
Which of the following is a feature of this patient condition?","{'A': 'It carries a good prognosis', 'B': 'Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis', 'C': 'It is a diagnosis of exclusion', 'D': 'It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis', 'E': 'Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality'}",C,"The patient's presentation of black, tarry stools (melena) and guaiac-positive stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. The history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, along with the physical examination findings of jaundice, lethargy, confusion, asterixis, and moderate ascites, point towards hepatic encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver dysfunction. The liver function tests show a low total albumin level, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated total bilirubin, and significantly elevated ALT and AST, which are consistent with liver dysfunction.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A. It carries a good prognosis - Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious condition and does not carry a good prognosis, especially in the setting of liver cirrhosis.

B. Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While ammonia levels can be elevated in hepatic encephalopathy, it is not the best initial test. Rather, it is the reduction in ammonia production and the clearance of ammonia by lactulose (a medication used to treat hepatic encephalopathy) that is therapeutic.

C. It is a diagnosis of exclusion - Hepatic encephalopathy is not a diagnosis of exclusion. There are specific clinical criteria and laboratory tests that can support the diagnosis.

D. It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - While hepatic encephalopathy is commonly associated with cirrhosis, it can also occur in other conditions that cause liver dysfunction.

E. Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality - EEG findings in hepatic encephalopathy typically do not show focal localising abnormalities. Instead, they may show generalized slowing of the background rhythm.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate option is B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis. Although ammonia levels are not the definitive test, they can support the diagnosis and are often measured in the clinical setting.

Therefore, the answer is B) Ammonia level is",B,False
"A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of excessive fatigue and weakness for the last several weeks. He also complains of abdominal pain and constipation for the same duration. On further questioning, he reports that he has lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Past medical history and family history are insignificant. His temperature is 37.3° C (99.2° F), respirations are 21/min, pulse is 63/min, and blood pressure is 99/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is a tired-appearing, thin male. He has a bronze discoloration to his skin, but he denies being outside in the sun or any history of laying in tanning beds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?","{'A': 'Administer intravenous hydrocortisone', 'B': 'Administer intravenous fludrocortisone', 'C': 'Start him on androgen replacement treatment', 'D': 'Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy', 'E': 'Order an ACTH stimulation test'}",D,"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss. The physical examination reveals a tired-appearing, thin male with a bronze discoloration of the skin. The combination of these symptoms, particularly the skin discoloration and weight loss, along with the abdominal symptoms, suggests the possibility of Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency). Addison's disease is characterized by the inadequate production of adrenal hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone.

The next best step in the management of this patient would be to confirm the diagnosis of Addison's disease. An ACTH stimulation test is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. This test measures the adrenal glands' response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which should stimulate the production of cortisol. In patients with Addison's disease, the cortisol response to ACTH is blunted or absent.

Therefore, the correct answer is E) Order an ACTH stimulation test.",A,False
A 58-year-old white man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a painless lesion on his lower lip. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He has worked as a fruit picker for the past 25 years. His current medications include captopril and metformin.

"A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?","{'A': 'Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion', 'B': ""Right-sided Horner's syndrome"", 'C': 'Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement', 'D': 'Right-sided analgesia', 'E': 'Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception'}",D,"The patient has a left C5 hemicord lesion, which suggests that the injury is on the left side of the spinal cord at the C5 level. This can cause damage to the structures on the same side of the lesion.

A. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This is likely to occur because the corticospinal tract, which controls voluntary movement, crosses over to the opposite side of the body at the level of the medulla. Therefore, a lesion in the cervical region would cause spastic paralysis on the opposite side of the body (contralateral) due to interruption of the descending motor pathway.

B. Right-sided Horner's syndrome: Horner's syndrome is characterized by ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating) on the affected side. Since the patient's lesion is on the left side, this would not cause right-sided Horner's syndrome.

C. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: The corticospinal tract is involved in motor control, and damage to it would cause contralateral symptoms. However, the question specifically mentions a hemicord lesion, which implies that only one side of the spinal cord is affected. Therefore, contralateral corticospinal tract involvement is not likely.

D. Right-sided analgesia: Analgesia refers to the absence of pain sensation. A lesion in the left C5 hemicord would not typically cause right-sided analgesia.

E. Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: The dorsal columns of the spinal cord carry information about vibration and proprioception. Damage to these fibers would cause loss of these sensations on the contralateral side of the body. However, the question specifies a hemicord lesion, which would not typically affect the dorsal columns comprehensively enough to cause contralateral symptoms.

Based on the information provided, the most likely finding in this patient would be A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion because the corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement control and crosses over to the opposite side of the body. Therefore, a left",C,False
"A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions.

Predictors of good prognosis in schizophrenia include affective symptoms, slow onset, negative symptoms, and being single. However, male sex is generally associated with a worse prognosis in schizophrenia. Therefore, the correct answer is E) Negative symptoms.",E,False
"A 26-year-old man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs on presentation are T 99.0 F, BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 125 bpm, RR 16/min, SpO2 98% on room air. He complains of extreme abdominal pain worse in the left upper quadrant which has worsened over the past 30 minutes. Exam demonstrates abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion. Bedside sonography shows evidence for hemoperitoneum. Despite administering more intravenous fluids, repeat vitals are T 98.9 F, BP 82/50 mm hg, HR 180 bpm, RR 20/min, SpO2 97% on room air. Which of the following is the best next step?","{'A': 'Normal saline bolus and re-evaluation of hemodynamics after infusion', 'B': 'CT abdomen and pelvis', 'C': 'Morphine', 'D': 'Abdominal plain film', 'E': 'Exploratory laparotomy'}",E,"The patient presents with signs of hypotension (BP 100/60 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 125 bpm), and extreme abdominal pain localized to the left upper quadrant, along with abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion. These findings are suggestive of an acute abdomen, likely due to intra-abdominal bleeding given the evidence of hemoperitoneum on bedside sonography. Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's condition is deteriorating, as evidenced by worsening hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 180 bpm). This indicates ongoing hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability, which necessitates immediate surgical intervention to identify and control the source of bleeding. Therefore, the best next step is E) Exploratory laparotomy.",B,False
"A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence. Physical exam was unremarkable except for some point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. What is the most likely imaging finding in this patient?","{'A': 'Blastic lesions of the lumbar spine', 'B': 'Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve', 'C': 'Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine', 'D': 'Narrowing of the lumbar disc space', 'E': 'Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine'}",C,"The patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer, which was successfully treated, is significant. The fact that a PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence is also important. The patient's complaint of subacute back pain that is worse at night and the point tenderness along the lumbosacral area on physical exam are clues to the possible cause of his back pain.

Given the patient's history of lung cancer, the most likely cause of his back pain would be metastasis to the bone. Blastic lesions are more common in lung cancer metastasis to the spine compared to lytic lesions. Therefore, the most likely imaging finding would be blastic lesions of the lumbar spine.

Therefore, the answer is A) Blastic lesions of the lumbar spine.",A,False
"A 22-year-old female college student is treated with metronidazole after presenting to student health services with itching, discharge, and pain in her vagina. At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol.

Metronidazole is known to cause this reaction when taken with alcohol. Metronidazole inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde, the toxic metabolite of alcohol. As a result, acetaldehyde accumulates and causes the unpleasant symptoms of the disulfiram-like reaction. Therefore, the answer is A) Acetaldehyde.",A,True
"A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care.

"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago. He describes the vomitus as bloody and containing black specks. He drinks 10–12 beers daily and has not seen a physician in 15 years. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?","{'A': 'Systemic vascular resistance', 'B': 'Fractional tissue oxygen extraction', 'C': 'Carotid baroreceptor firing activity', 'D': 'Pulmonary vascular resistance', 'E': 'Cardiac inotropy'}",C,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by the bloody vomitus containing black specks (likely coffee grounds). His vital signs indicate tachycardia (pulse of 122/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg), which are consistent with hypovolemic shock due to acute blood loss. The presence of spider angiomata suggests chronic liver disease, which could be a source of bleeding. The distended abdomen may indicate ascites, also a feature of liver cirrhosis.

In response to hypovolemic shock, the body activates compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. These mechanisms include increased systemic vascular resistance (to maintain blood pressure) and increased fractional tissue oxygen extraction (to optimize oxygen delivery to tissues).

Given the patient's condition, we can expect an increase in systemic vascular resistance (A) to maintain blood pressure and an increase in fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B) to optimize oxygen delivery to tissues. Carotid baroreceptor firing activity (C) would decrease in response to the hypotension, not increase. Pulmonary vascular resistance (D) is not directly related to the compensatory mechanisms for hypovolemic shock. Cardiac inotropy (E) may decrease as a result of reduced preload and afterload due to blood loss, but this is not the primary compensatory response being asked about in the question.

Therefore, the most likely decreased parameter in response to the patient's current condition compared to a healthy adult is pulmonary vascular resistance (D), as the body shifts blood away from the pulmonary circulation to maintain systemic perfusion.

The answer is D) Pulmonary vascular resistance.",D,False
"A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?","{'A': 'Hypersegmented neutrophils', 'B': 'Schistocytes', 'C': 'Sideroblasts', 'D': 'Spherocytes', 'E': 'Dacrocytes'}",D,"The patient's presentation of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and the presence of a gallstone suggest a hematologic disorder as the underlying cause of the gallstone formation. The findings of a mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis and increased RDW indicate a hemolytic process. The indirect hyperbilirubinemia and negative Coombs test suggest an extravascular hemolytic anemia. The increased osmotic fragility in hypotonic solution further supports the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by the presence of spherocytes on blood smear. Therefore, the most likely finding on a blood smear in this patient would be D) Spherocytes.",D,True
"A 34-year-old woman presents to the plastic surgery office 3 months following a rhinoplasty procedure. The patient has been recovering well. However, she has noticed a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which you appreciate on physical exam. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this phenomenon?","{'A': 'Post-operative swelling', 'B': 'A septal hematoma causing a perforation', 'C': 'A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow', 'D': 'Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow', 'E': 'A fracture of the bony septum'}",B,"The whistling noise the patient is experiencing is likely due to a change in the nasal airflow caused by the recent rhinoplasty procedure. The most likely cause of this change in airflow would be a structural alteration to the nasal septum. Since the patient reports a whistling noise rather than a hissing sound, which might suggest a septal perforation, and there is no mention of trauma or complications that would suggest a fracture, options B and E are less likely. Post-operative swelling (option A) would not typically cause a whistling noise, and excessive columellar show (option D) would not be a common cause of this symptom either. The most likely cause, therefore, is a deviated septum that has been straightened during the rhinoplasty, resulting in altered nasal airflow. Therefore, the answer is C) A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.",A,False
"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.

A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. He has been healthy apart from an upper respiratory tract infection 6 months ago. He was delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. His 6-year-old sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip. He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,"{'A': 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'B': 'Reassurance and follow-up', 'C': 'X-ray of the lower extremities', 'D': 'Bracing of the lower extremities', 'E': 'Tibial osteotomy'}",B,"The child in the question is a 21-month-old boy who has leg deformities since he started walking independently. His developmental milestones are appropriate for his age, as he can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase, and he plays well with other children. His growth parameters are within normal limits, with a height at the 40th percentile and weight at the 50th percentile. His sister had developmental dysplasia of the hip, but there is no indication that the boy has the same condition. His gait is unremarkable, and the examination shows no abnormalities except for the knees not staying together when the feet and ankles are placed together. This finding suggests that the boy may have flexible joints, which is a normal finding in toddlers and does not necessarily indicate a growth disorder.

Given the information provided, the most appropriate next step in management would be to reassure the mother and schedule follow-up visits to monitor the child's development and growth. Vitamin D supplementation is not indicated unless there is a specific deficiency. An X-ray of the lower extremities is not necessary at this point without any signs of serious pathology. Bracing of the lower extremities is not appropriate as there is no evidence of joint instability or significant deformity requiring orthopedic intervention. Tibial osteotomy is a surgical procedure that is not indicated in this scenario.

Therefore, the answer is B) Reassurance and follow-up.",B,True
A 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension presents to an outpatient office for regular check-up and is found to have hypertriglyceridemia. Her physician prescribes high-dose niacin and recommends taking the medication along with aspirin. The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?,"{'A': 'Bile deposition in the dermis', 'B': 'Immune complex formation', 'C': 'Release of prostaglandins', 'D': 'Mast cell degranulation', 'E': 'T cell activation'}",C,The side effect that the physician is trying to avoid by prescribing high-dose niacin along with aspirin is thought to be mediated by which mechanism?,,False
"A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","{'A': 'Alzheimer dementia', 'B': 'Delirium', 'C': 'Lewy body dementia', 'D': 'Normal pressure hydrocephalus', 'E': 'Pseudodementia'}",B,"The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been experiencing a decline in her cognitive function, as evidenced by her disorientation to place or situation, failure to recognize her doctor despite a long-standing relationship, and intermittent somnolence throughout the interview. Additionally, she has difficulty recalling words (0/3 after 5 minutes), increased urinary urgency with episodes of incontinence, and a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that worsens with deliberate movement. She also has a history of drinking 4-6 glasses of wine per day.

Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is:

C) Lewy body dementia

Lewy body dementia is characterized by fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism (such as the low-frequency tremor described), and falls. The patient's symptoms align with these criteria, making Lewy body dementia a more likely diagnosis than Alzheimer's dementia, which typically presents with memory loss as the initial and most prominent feature. Delirium is less likely given the absence of an acute change in mental status or underlying medical condition that could cause it. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, but the patient's primary issue seems to be cognitive decline with parkinsonian features rather than gait disturbance. Pseudodementia refers to a situation where depression causes cognitive impairment that mimics dementia, but the patient's presentation does not strongly suggest depression as the primary issue.",C,False
"A 58-year-old male presents with an acutely elevated blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg. The patient complains of a headache and chest pain, and he has been vomiting for the last several hours. Physical exam demonstrates papilledema and a depressed level of consciousness. To treat this patient's hypertensive emergency, he is started on an IV medication commonly used in this situation. The agent exerts its effect by releasing nitric oxide as a metabolite, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Which of the following clinical effects would be expected from administration of this medication?","{'A': 'Decreased cardiac contractility', 'B': 'Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure', 'C': 'Decreased stroke volume', 'D': 'Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure', 'E': 'Increased systemic vascular resistance'}",D,"The medication described in the question is likely nitroglycerin or a similar nitrate, which is commonly used in hypertensive emergencies. Nitrates work by releasing nitric oxide (NO), which then activates guanylate cyclase and increases the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle. This leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle and dilation of the veins and arteries.

The clinical effects of this medication would include decreased preload (since the veins dilate) and decreased afterload (due to arterial dilation). These effects lead to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

Among the options provided, the one that matches the expected clinical effect of the medication is:

D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure

This is because the medication will decrease the preload and afterload on the heart, leading to a decrease in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is an estimate of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

Therefore, the answer is D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.",D,True

"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?","{'A': '67%', 'B': '33%', 'C': '100%', 'D': '75%', 'E': '50%'}",A,"The condition described in the question is consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder. The woman's brother has the condition, which means that both of his parents are carriers of the PKU gene. Since the woman does not exhibit symptoms of PKU and her parents are healthy, we can infer that she has a 50% chance of being a carrier herself.

To determine her carrier status, we need to consider the probability of her parents being carriers and passing on the gene to her. Since both of her parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that she inherited the gene from each parent. However, because PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, she would only be a carrier if she inherited the gene from one parent.

The probability of her being a carrier is the product of the probabilities of inheriting the gene from each parent:

Probability (Carrier) = Probability (Inheriting gene from father) * Probability (Inheriting gene from mother)
                      = 1/2 * 1/2
                      = 1/4

Therefore, the answer is A) 67%.",A,True
"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. He was at a college party exhibiting belligerent behavior when he suddenly passed out and fell to the ground. His past medical history is not known. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is covered with emesis and responds incoherently to questions. As the patient begins to wake up he continues vomiting. The patient is started on IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics and begins to feel better. Thirty minutes later the patient presents with muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's basic laboratory studies are drawn and he is started on IV fluids, given lorazepam, and placed under a cooling blanket. Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","{'A': 'Acetaminophen', 'B': 'Dantrolene', 'C': 'Diazepam', 'D': 'Intubation', 'E': 'Supportive therapy'}",B,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute alcohol intoxication, as suggested by the sudden onset of symptoms after alcohol consumption, the presence of vomiting, and the subsequent development of muscle rigidity and altered mental status. The patient's symptoms, including hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and altered mental status, are indicative of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can progress to a severe and potentially life-threatening condition known as alcoholic ketoacidosis.

The initial management of alcohol withdrawal involves supportive therapy, including IV fluids, benzodiazepines, and monitoring for complications. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, has already been administered to the patient, which is appropriate for managing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms persist despite initial measures, indicating the need for further intervention.

Option A (Acetaminophen) is not the best next step as it is used to reduce fever and treat pain but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B (Dantrolene) is used to treat malignant hyperthermia, a different condition characterized by a hypermetabolic state triggered by certain anesthetic agents, which is not the case here.

Option C (Diazepam) is another benzodiazepine that could be used to manage alcohol withdrawal, but since the patient has already received lorazepam, additional benzodiazepines may not be the most appropriate next step without further information on the patient's response to initial treatment.

Option D (Intubation) may be considered if the patient's airway is compromised or if respiratory failure occurs, but there is no indication from the information provided that the patient's respiratory status is inadequate.

Option E (Supportive therapy) is the most appropriate next step in management. This includes continuing IV fluids and benzodiazepines, monitoring for complications, and providing a cool environment to manage hyperthermia.

Therefore, the answer is E) Supportive therapy.",A,False
"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?","{'A': 'An increase in right atrial pressure', 'B': 'An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure', 'C': 'An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure', 'D': 'A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential', 'E': 'A reduction in diastolic filling time'}",E,"The murmur described is characteristic of aortic stenosis, which is a valvular heart disease. When a patient with aortic stenosis stands up from a supine position, gravity causes blood to pool in the lower extremities and abdominal organs. This reduces the venous return to the heart, leading to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure. As a result, the gradient across the aortic valve increases, making the murmur louder. This maneuver does not directly affect right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, the slope of the pacemaker potential, or diastolic filling time in the context described. Therefore, the correct answer is B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.",A,False
"A 39-year-old African-American woman presents to the emergency room with hip pain.

Given her background of sarcoidosis, it is important to consider the possibility of sarcoidosis involving the musculoskeletal system, which can affect the hips. The most sensitive test to evaluate for sarcoidosis in the hips would be an MRI, as it can detect early changes in the soft tissues and bone marrow that may not be visible on other imaging modalities such as CT, radiographs, or radionuclide scans. Ultrasound is not typically used for the evaluation of sarcoidosis in the hips. Therefore, the answer is B) MRI of the hip.",B,True
"A 74-year-old man undergoes an open cholecystectomy. Surgery is performed under general anesthesia for which the patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube. Directly following the procedure, his temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is extubated as soon as he showed signs of alertness. Five minutes later, he becomes unresponsive. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He underwent stenting of the right coronary artery 10 years ago. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 2 weeks ago for surgery. He drinks one to two beers daily.

Shortly thereafter, he became unresponsive with a low oxygen saturation of 73%. Despite being placed on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%, his oxygen saturation remains low at 73%. His arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32, PCO2 of 33 mm Hg, PO2 of 73 mm Hg, and HCO3 of 22 mEq/L, indicating hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to secure his airway and provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. The options provided are tracheostomy, continuing with the non-rebreather mask, reintubation, close observation only, or starting BiPAP.

Option A (Perform tracheostomy) is a more invasive procedure and is not typically the first step in managing postoperative respiratory failure.

Option B (Continue using the non-rebreather mask) is not appropriate as the patient's oxygen saturation has not improved despite the use of the non-rebreather mask.

Option C (Reintubation) is the most appropriate option as it would allow for controlled ventilation and improved oxygenation, which is necessary given the patient's current state.

Option D (Close observation only) is not appropriate as the patient is unresponsive and requires immediate intervention.

Option E (Start BiPAP) could be considered in some cases of respiratory failure; however, given the patient's unresponsiveness and the need for immediate intervention, reintubation would provide a more secure airway and better oxygenation.

Therefore, the answer is C) Reintubate.",A,False

He has had 2 children from a previous marriage and has been tested for causes of male infertility. She has had prior abdominal surgery as well as a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Based on this history, a panel of tests are obtained and treatment is started. This treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. If the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?","{'A': 'Diabetes', 'B': 'Parkinson disease', 'C': 'Polycystic ovarian syndrome', 'D': 'Premature labor', 'E': 'Prostate cancer'}",E,"The patient has been trying to conceive for 2 years, indicating a possible case of infertility. Given her history of abdominal surgery and family history of endocrine abnormalities, it is likely that she may have a condition such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which can cause infertility. The drug commonly prescribed in such cases is clomiphene citrate, which is used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS. Clomiphene citrate is typically administered intermittently in a cyclical pattern, starting from the first day of the menstrual cycle and continuing for several days. If this drug were administered in a different manner (e.g., continuously), it could also be used to treat conditions such as endometriosis or as a contraceptive. However, since the question specifies that the treatment will be administered one week before the normal menstrual cycle, it is more likely that the drug is being used to treat a luteal phase defect or to induce ovulation at the appropriate time. Among the options provided, the condition that is also treated by a drug administered in a different manner (continuously or intermittently) is E) Prostate cancer, as clomiphene citrate can be used in the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.",C,False
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. The patient lives in a nursing home and has Alzheimer dementia at baseline. His nurse noticed that he was more confused than usual and was somnolent for the past 12 hours. The patient’s nurse also noticed that he was soiling his diapers more frequently with copious amounts of urine. The patient has lost 15 pounds since his last physician appointment 3 weeks ago. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL
PTH: 8 pg/mL

The patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms?","{'A': 'Alendronate', 'B': 'Calcitonin', 'C': 'Furosemide', 'D': 'IV fluids', 'E': 'Teriparatide'}",A,"The patient presents with confusion, somnolence, polyuria, and weight loss. The laboratory values show a high calcium level (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL) and a normal phosphate level (PO4-: 2.5 mg/dL). The PTH level is also within normal limits (8 pg/mL). The combination of high calcium and normal PTH suggests a non-PTH mediated hypercalcemia. The patient's symptoms and hypercalcemia could be due to a malignancy, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which can cause humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) through the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP).

The best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient's acute symptoms, assuming a malignancy is the underlying cause, would be an option that addresses the hypercalcemia of malignancy. Among the options provided, calcitonin (B) and furosemide (C) can be used to treat hypercalcemia, but they are not typically used for long-term prophylaxis. Alendronate (A) is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, but it is not the first-line treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy. Teriparatide (E) is an anabolic agent used for osteoporosis and is not indicated in the treatment of hypercalcemia.

The best option for long-term prophylaxis in the context of hypercalcemia of malignancy is IV fluids (D). Adequate hydration helps to dilute the serum calcium concentration and increases renal calcium excretion. This is often the first step in managing hypercalcemia, especially in the setting of malignancy.

Therefore, the answer is D) IV fluids.",D,False
"A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?","{'A': 'Phototherapy', 'B': 'Phenobarbital administration', 'C': 'Plasma exchange', 'D': 'Switch from breast milk to formula', 'E': 'Continue normal breast feeding'}",E,"The infant described in the question is presenting with jaundice, which is characterized by yellowing of the skin. This is a common condition in newborns and is often due to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The fact that the infant is feeding well and sleeping through the night suggests that the jaundice is not due to inadequate intake or dehydration.

The treatment for neonatal jaundice depends on the severity of the hyperbilirubinemia and the age of the infant. In a one-week-old infant with mild jaundice, the best initial treatment is usually to continue normal breastfeeding. Phototherapy is typically reserved for more severe cases or when the bilirubin levels are rising despite adequate breastfeeding. Phenobarbital is used in the treatment of seizures and is not indicated for jaundice. Plasma exchange is a treatment for severe hyperbilirubinemia and is not typically used as a first-line treatment. Switching from breast milk to formula is not necessary unless there is a specific indication, such as intolerance to breast milk or failure to thrive.

Therefore, the best treatment for this infant with mild jaundice is to continue normal breastfeeding. The answer is E) Continue normal breastfeeding.",E,True
"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?","{'A': 'The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.', 'B': 'The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.', 'C': 'The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.', 'D': 'One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.', 'E': 'The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.'}",A,"The odds ratio of 2.1 indicates that individuals with low educational status have a 2.1 times higher risk of myocardial infarction compared to those with high educational status. The confidence interval ranges from 0.9 to 9.7. Although the lower limit of the confidence interval is below 1, the upper limit is above 1, suggesting that the odds ratio is statistically significant. Therefore, the association between low education and the risk of MI is statistically significant. Additionally, since the odds ratio is greater than 1, it indicates that low education is indeed a risk factor for MI. Hence, the correct answer is E) The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.",A,True
"A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Diaphragmatic rupture', 'B': 'Traumatic bronchial rupture', 'C': 'Thoracic aortic rupture', 'D': 'Cardiac tamponade', 'E': 'Tension pneumothorax'}",C,"The patient presents with severe facial lacerations, respiratory distress, hypoxemia (oxygen saturation of 70%), tachycardia (pulse of 130/min), and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg). The physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, which suggests a possible pleural effusion or hemothorax. The chest x-ray findings of a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum are significant.

Option A, diaphragmatic rupture, typically presents with abdominal contents in the chest cavity on x-ray, which is not mentioned in the scenario.

Option B, traumatic bronchial rupture, can cause respiratory distress and subcutaneous emphysema but would not explain the widened mediastinum or the deviation of the nasogastric tube.

Option C, thoracic aortic rupture, is a possibility given the widened mediastinum on the x-ray, which can be a sign of aortic injury. However, the patient's presentation with respiratory distress and the other findings may not be typical for an aortic rupture.

Option D, cardiac tamponade, is characterized by hypotension, muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and clear lungs on auscultation (Beck's triad), which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Option E, tension pneumothorax, is a likely diagnosis given the patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and the presence of dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over one lung base. The widened mediastinum on the x-ray can be due to the pressure from the trapped air in the pleural space pushing the mediastinal structures apart. The deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right suggests a shift of the mediastinum away from the side of the tube insertion, which is consistent with tension pneumothorax.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is tension pneumothor",A,False
"A 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presents to your primary care office with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. On exam, you note an elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema?","{'A': 'Increase in capillary pressure', 'B': 'Decrease in plasma proteins', 'C': 'Increase in capillary permeability', 'D': 'Increase in colloid osmotic pressure', 'E': 'Increase in interstitial fluid pressure'}",A,"The patient's history of myocardial infarction and symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles, along with physical exam findings of elevated JVP and pitting edema, suggest heart failure. In heart failure, the heart's reduced ability to pump effectively leads to an increase in venous pressure, which in turn increases capillary pressure. This increased capillary pressure can cause fluid to leak into the interstitial space, resulting in edema. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is an increase in capillary pressure. The answer is A) Increase in capillary pressure.",A,True
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of a headache. The last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She also reports having a mild headache for 1 month. There has been a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days. On examination, the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus and no fetal heart sounds are heard. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min. On USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. What will be the genotype of the substance which will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation?","{'A': '69XXY', 'B': '45XO', 'C': '23XX', 'D': '47XYY', 'E': '46XX'}",E,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a molar pregnancy, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. This condition is characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblasts, the cells that normally develop into the placenta. The absence of fetal parts on USG examination, along with the presence of a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina and high blood pressure, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Molar pregnancies can be complete or partial. A complete molar pregnancy, which is more common, occurs when an empty egg is fertilized by a sperm, resulting in a gestational sac filled with trophoblasts but no fetus. A partial molar pregnancy occurs when two sperms fertilize a normal egg, leading to the development of an abnormal fetus that usually does not survive.

In this case, since no fetal parts are seen on USG and the patient has a grape-like mass, it is likely that the substance aspirated by dilation and evacuation will be from a complete molar pregnancy. The genotype of the substance in a complete molar pregnancy is typically 46XX, which is a normal female diploid genotype.

Therefore, the answer is E) 46XX.",E,True

Reduced renal blood flow can activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to various changes within the kidney. One of the effects of the activated RAAS is the constriction of the efferent arterioles, which helps to maintain glomerular filtration pressure. This constriction can lead to hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells (option A) due to increased sympathetic activity and the release of renin in response to decreased renal perfusion.

Therefore, the answer is A) Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells.",A,True
"A 29-year-old G1P0 woman is giving birth at 38 weeks gestation to a  boy via vaginal delivery. As soon as the infant is clear of the vagina, a congenital malformation of the abdomen is observed.

The laboratory findings of a low hemoglobin concentration (7.2 g/dL) and hematocrit (32%) confirm this. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 68 μm3 indicates that the anemia is microcytic (MCV < 80 μm3).

The most common causes of microcytic anemia include iron deficiency, thalassemia, and anemia of chronic disease. Given the patient's history of blood in his stools, iron deficiency anemia secondary to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most likely cause.

Now, let's consider the options provided:

A) Dilated submucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus - This refers to esophageal varices, which are typically associated with portal hypertension and not usually a cause of microcytic anemia.

B) Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall - This describes diverticulitis, which can cause bleeding but is not typically associated with microcytic anemia unless chronic and leading to iron deficiency.

C) Symptomatic enlargement of hemorrhoidal plexus - Hemorrhoids can cause bleeding, but they are not a common cause of microcytic anemia unless the bleeding is chronic and leads to iron deficiency.

D) Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon - This is a description of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which can cause chronic blood loss and lead to iron deficiency anemia.

E) Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall - Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can cause bleeding, but they are not a common cause of microcytic anemia unless the bleeding is significant and chronic.

Given the patient's presentation and the fact that he has had blood in his stools",C,False
"Researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis.

A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?,"{'A': '9/100', 'B': '1/10', 'C': '18/100', 'D': '81/100', 'E': '9/10'}",A,"The disease in question is cystic fibrosis (CF), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Since the woman has the disease phenotype, she must be homozygous for the CF gene (CF/CF). The man does not have the disease phenotype, so he must be either heterozygous (CF/normal) or homozygous for the normal allele (normal/normal).

To determine the chance that their child will have CF, we need to consider the possible genotypes of their offspring. Each child of this couple has a 50% chance of inheriting the CF gene from the mother and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal gene from the father.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

- There is a 50% chance that the child will inherit the CF gene from the mother (CF/CF).
- There is a 50% chance that the child will inherit the normal gene from the father (normal/normal).

If the child inherits the CF gene from the mother, the child will have CF (1/100 prevalence does not matter here because we are looking at the chance of the child being affected, not the prevalence in the population).

If the child inherits the normal gene from the father, the child will not have CF.

So, the chance that the child will have CF is the probability of inheriting the CF gene from the mother multiplied by 1 (because once the CF gene is inherited, the child will have CF regardless of the father's gene).

Chance of child having CF = Probability of inheriting CF gene from mother * 1
= 1/2 * 1
= 1/2 or 0.5

Since none of the answer choices match 0.5, there seems to be an error in the question or the options provided. However, if we consider the prevalence of CF in the population as 1/100, it suggests that the disease is very rare. If we assume that the man is heterozygous (CF/normal), then the chance of the child having CF would be 1/4, which corresponds to option B (1/10).

Therefore, the answer is B) 1/10.",B,False
An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer.

The drug that is indicated for preventing further bone resorption and reducing the risk of developing breast cancer is a bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates are known to put patients at an increased risk of esophageal irritation, which could be problematic given the patient's history of esophageal stricture due to gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, none of the options provided directly relate to this known adverse effect. Instead, we need to select the best available option from the given choices.

Option A, Mandibular osteonecrosis, is a known but rare side effect of bisphosphonates, particularly in patients with dental procedures or poor dental hygiene.
Option B, Skin infections, are not commonly associated with bisphosphonate use.
Option C, Osteosarcoma, is a type of bone cancer and is not associated with bisphosphonate use.

The next best step in the management of this patient would be to administer a vasopressor to address the persistent hypotension.

Dopamine and norepinephrine are both vasopressors that can be used in the management of hypotension. However, norepinephrine is often preferred in the setting of anaphylaxis because it is more potent in increasing systemic vascular resistance and has a lower risk of reflex bradycardia compared to dopamine.

Therefore, the answer is E) Administer norepinephrine.",E,False

"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high speed motor-vehicle collision in which he was an unrestrained passenger. He has acute myeloid leukemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy. On arrival, his temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands, but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen.

He has a history of acute myeloid leukemia and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. On arrival, his vital signs are within normal limits, but he has multiple bruises, a laceration on his right cheek, and shows signs of decreased consciousness as he does not respond to commands but does groan. He has decreased breath sounds over the right lung base and tenderness over the left chest wall. There is also swelling in the right elbow and wrist, and a shorter right lower extremity with lacerations and swollen knee.

Given the mechanism of injury and the physical findings, the most concerning injuries are traumatic brain injury (TBI) and potential spinal injury due to the shortening of a limb. The patient's decreased level of consciousness and the presence of a laceration over his right cheek suggest facial trauma, which could be associated with a TBI. The swelling of the right elbow and wrist, along with the shortening of the right lower extremity, raises concern for potential fractures or dislocations that could compromise circulation or be associated with a spinal injury.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform imaging to assess for these injuries. A CT scan of the head and neck (Option C) would be appropriate to evaluate for TBI and facial fractures. Additionally, given the potential for spinal injury, a CT scan of the spine should also be considered. While a FAST exam (Option A) is useful for evaluating for intra-abdominal bleeding, the patient's abdomen is soft and there are no signs of guarding or rebound tenderness, making this less likely. Insertion of an intercostal chest tube (Option B) would be indicated if there were signs of a pneumothorax or hemothorax, which are not evident based on the provided information. X-rays of the extremities (Option D) could help identify fractures but would not be as comprehensive as a CT scan for evaluating potential spinal injury. Intubation and mechanical ventilation (Option E) may be necessary if the patient's airway is compromised or if he has significant respiratory distress, but there is no indication of airway compromise at this time.

"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38°C (100.5°F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities.

The laboratory results indicate anemia with a low mean corpuscular volume, high platelet count, low serum ferritin, low serum iron, and low total iron-binding capacity. These findings suggest iron deficiency anemia. The presence of conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae, and a diastolic murmur suggests a bleeding disorder and possible endocarditis. The high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border and the head bobbing with each heartbeat are suggestive of aortic regurgitation. The small, painless, red macules on both palms are Janeway lesions, which are associated with infective endocarditis. The palpable spleen could be due to splenic sequestration of blood cells secondary to a bleeding disorder or splenic infarction from septic emboli. The colonoscopy with biopsy showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon confirms the presence of a malignancy.

The most likely explanation for his cardiac findings, in this case, is infective endocarditis secondary to the malignant colonic neoplasm. The neoplasm could cause a hypercoagulable state leading to septic emboli and endocarditis. Therefore, the answer is C) Malignant colonic neoplasm.",C,False

The presence of bilateral mediastinal masses is particularly characteristic of thymic lymphomas, which are often associated with the presence of the thymus in the mediastinum.

The histopathological findings associated with each option are as follows:
A. Cells staining positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase are typically seen in hairy cell leukemia.
B. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30 are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma.
C. Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement are seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
D. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 are often found in follicular lymphoma.
E. Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation are characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma.

The patient's history of asthma and his father's history of lung cancer are not immediately relevant to the acute presentation. The absence of cardiac abnormalities on examination makes congestive heart failure an unlikely cause of his symptoms. Atelectasis, or collapse of the lung, is a common postoperative complication, especially in patients with a history of smoking and those who have undergone abdominal surgery, as it can be difficult to fully expand the lungs in the supine position.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Korsakoff syndrome', 'B': 'Subacute combined degeneration', 'C': 'Methanol poisoning', 'D': 'Cerebellar degeneration', 'E': ""Wernicke's encephalopathy""}",D,"The patient presents with multiple falls, episodes of dizziness, a wide-based gait, inability to stand with feet together without support, coarse tremor of the hands, impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands, but normal muscle strength, tone, and sensation. These findings suggest a problem with coordination and balance, which are functions primarily controlled by the cerebellum.

Korsakoff syndrome (A) and Wernicke's encephalopathy (E) are both associated with thiamine deficiency and are characterized by mental status abnormalities, which this patient does not have.

Subacute combined degeneration (B) is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and typically presents with sensory deficits and spastic paraparesis, which are not seen in this patient.

Methanol poisoning (C) can cause visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and can lead to cerebral edema and death. It does not typically present with isolated ataxia and tremor without other systemic signs.

Cerebellar degeneration (D) can present with ataxia, wide-based gait, tremor, and impaired coordination without affecting muscle strength or sensation, which fits the presentation of this patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is cerebellar degeneration.",A,False
"A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated by her primary care physician for chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago. This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable.

The best treatment option for fibromyalgia is typically a multimodal approach that includes exercise, physical therapy, and medications such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants. Given the patient's history of generalized anxiety disorder and previous use of paroxetine, it would be reasonable to consider restarting an antidepressant. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can be effective for both anxiety and pain modulation in fibromyalgia. Therefore, the answer is C) Paroxetine.",C,True
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 13 g/dL

The clinical presentation includes Charcot's triad of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The presence of altered mental status (disorientation to time) and hypotension (blood pressure 112/82 mm Hg) suggests the development of Reynold's pentad, which is a sign of severe cholangitis and indicates the need for urgent biliary decompression.

The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder are consistent with gallstones and choledocholithiasis (stones in the common bile duct). The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with suspected cholangitis and evidence of bile duct obstruction is urgent biliary decompression.

Option B, ERCP, is the procedure of choice for both diagnosing and treating choledocholithiasis and cholangitis. It allows for the removal of stones from the common bile duct and the relief of biliary obstruction.

Therefore, the answer is B) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).",B,True
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to sore throat and fever. He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100°F (37.8 °C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth. A scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands from this patient. Which of the following findings would most likely be found in this patient?","{'A': 'Abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE)', 'B': 'Delayed separation of the umbilical cord', 'C': 'Hypoparathyroidism', 'D': 'Partial albinism', 'E': 'Thrombocytopenic purpura'}",C,"The patient's presentation with sore throat, fever, and white plaques on the tongue and mouth, along with the characteristic morphology of the scraping material after KOH treatment, is suggestive of oral candidiasis (thrush). This is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients. The normal distribution of serum protein electrophoresis bands indicates that there is no abnormal immunoglobulin band, which would be seen in conditions like multiple myeloma.

Given the patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and cardiac surgery in infancy, one possible underlying condition could be an immunodeficiency disorder. Among the options provided, the most likely finding associated with an immunodeficiency that could present with recurrent infections and oral candidiasis is abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE). AIRE gene mutations are responsible for Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED), which is characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency.

Therefore, the answer is A) Abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE).",A,False
"A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness.

"A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","{'A': 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B': 'Hemophilia B', 'C': 'Immune thrombocytopenic purpura', 'D': 'Von Willebrand disease', 'E': 'Hemophilia A'}",D,"The patient presents with bruising and petechiae but has a normal complete blood count, which suggests that the platelet count is normal. The coagulation profile shows a normal prothrombin time (PT) but an elongated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which indicates a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway.

Option A, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is less likely because the complete blood count is normal, and there are no other symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or bone pain.

Option B, Hemophilia B, is a deficiency of factor IX, which would result in an elongated aPTT. However, this condition is rare in boys and typically presents with hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints) and muscle bleeds, which are not mentioned in the case.

Option C, Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), is characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and normal bone marrow, but the patient's platelet count is not low, so this diagnosis is unlikely.

Option D, Von Willebrand disease, is a common bleeding disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. However, it typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding (such as nosebleeds, menorrhagia) and may show an abnormal bleeding time, which is not provided in the case.

Option E, Hemophilia A, is a deficiency of factor VIII, which would result in an elongated aPTT. Hemophilia A is more common than Hemophilia B and typically presents with hemarthrosis and muscle bleeds, which are not mentioned in the case.

Given the information provided, none of the options seem to fit perfectly. The most likely diagnosis based on the given information would be von Willebrand disease (Option D), as it can present with petechiae and mucosal bleeding, and the absence of other symptoms or abnormal bleeding time does not rule it out. However, the case lacks some key clinical features that are typically associated with von Willebrand disease. Therefore, there might be an error in the question or the information provided.",A,False
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He says that these symptoms came on rapidly but does not recall anything that may have triggered the episode. He has never experienced these symptoms before. His past medical history is significant for obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. He also has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he occasionally takes antacids. On presentation he is found to have fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain that is poorly localized. Basic labs as well as an arterial blood gas are obtained and the results are shown below:

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 106 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
pH: 7.25
pCO2: 22 mmHg

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs?","{'A': 'Antacids', 'B': 'Anxiety', 'C': 'Diarrhea', 'D': 'Metformin', 'E': 'Sleep apnea'}",D,"The patient's lab results show a low HCO3- (bicarbonate) level and a low pH, indicating metabolic acidosis. The pCO2 is low, which suggests that the body is compensating by blowing off CO2 through the lungs (respiratory compensation). The question asks for the most likely cause of this metabolic acidosis.

Option A (Antacids) - Antacids can cause metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis, by neutralizing stomach acid.
Option B (Anxiety) - Anxiety can cause a variety of symptoms, but it is not a common cause of metabolic acidosis.
Option C (Diarrhea) - Diarrhea can lead to metabolic acidosis because the lost stool contains bicarbonate, which can result in a net loss of bicarbonate from the body.
Option D (Metformin) - Metformin is actually associated with a rare condition called metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), which can cause metabolic acidosis. However, this is a rare side effect and typically presents with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Option E (Sleep apnea) - Sleep apnea can lead to chronic respiratory acidosis due to repeated episodes of hypoventilation during sleep, but it does not typically cause metabolic acidosis.

Given the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and the absence of other more likely causes, diarrhea is the most probable cause of the metabolic acidosis seen in this patient.

Therefore, the answer is C) Diarrhea.",A,False
"A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory.

She also has a history of traveling to Arizona and visiting her family in Nigeria. Her physical examination reveals ciliary injection and photophobia in her left eye. The chest x-ray is not provided here, but it is mentioned that it shows some abnormalities.

Considering the geographical history, her occupation as a geology laboratory research assistant, and the symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Option C). Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an inflammation of the lung caused by an allergic reaction to inhaled organic dusts. As a geologist, she may have been exposed to organic dusts in her work environment, which can lead to this condition.

Sarcoidosis (Option A) is less likely because it typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is not mentioned in the case. Pulmonary tuberculosis (Option B) could be considered due to her travel history, but the lack of lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms makes it less likely. Hodgkin's lymphoma (Option D) usually presents with lymphadenopathy, which is not observed in this case. Histoplasmosis (Option E) is a fungal infection that can cause similar symptoms, but the patient's occupation and travel history to Nigeria make hypersensitivity pneumonitis a more likely diagnosis.

She reports that she has become unable to taste or smell her food. Two years later, the patient dies. At autopsy, examination of the brain shows generalized cortical atrophy. A photomicrograph of a section of the brain is shown. The inclusions indicated by the arrows are predominantly composed of which of the following substances?","{'A': 'Alpha-synuclein', 'B': 'Viral ribonuclear proteins', 'C': 'Amyloid-β', 'D': 'Hyperphosphorylated tau', 'E': 'Prion protein'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of impaired memory, word-finding difficulties, and inability to coordinate tasks, along with the autopsy finding of generalized cortical atrophy, are suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder. The fact that the patient was unable to taste or smell her food is also a clue. The most common neurodegenerative disorders that present with these symptoms are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the presence of inclusions in the brain is a key feature that helps differentiate between these conditions.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, which are composed of beta-amyloid protein (Amyloid-β). Parkinson's disease, on the other hand, is associated with Lewy bodies, which are composed of alpha-synuclein. The inability to taste or smell is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease and is related to the loss of function in the olfactory bulb, which can be affected by Lewy bodies.

The other options, such as viral ribonuclear proteins, hyperphosphorylated tau, and prion protein, are associated with other neurodegenerative disorders or conditions. For example, viral ribonuclear proteins may be seen in conditions like rabies or viral encephalitis, hyperphosphorylated tau is a characteristic of tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease, and prion protein is associated with prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Given the clinical presentation and the autopsy findings, the most likely cause of the inclusions indicated by the arrows in the photomicrograph is Lewy bodies composed of alpha-synuclein.

Therefore, the answer is A) Alpha-synuclein.",A,False
"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

After 4 weeks, pyrazinamide was removed due to potential adverse effects and antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine) was added because of his HIV infection. After another 3 weeks, the patient presents with fever, increased cough, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary infiltrates with mediastinal lymphadenopathy on chest radiograph. The sputum smear is negative, indicating that the tuberculosis is not active at the moment. The increased Mantoux test size suggests a possible hypersensitivity reaction to one of the antitubercular drugs. The patient's CD4+ T cell count has improved to 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL, indicating a response to antiretroviral therapy.

Given the clinical presentation and the negative sputum smear, it is unlikely that the patient has a recurrence of tuberculosis. The most likely explanation is a hypersensitivity reaction to one of the antitubercular drugs, possibly pyrazinamide, which was recently added to his regimen. The appropriate initial step would be to stop the antitubercular drug causing the hypersensitivity reaction and continue with the antiretroviral therapy.

Therefore, the answer is A) Stop antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular therapy.",A,False

"An investigator is studying the effects of different gastrointestinal regulatory substances. A healthy subject is asked to eat a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph?","{'A': 'Increased vagal stimulation', 'B': 'Increased activity of D cells', 'C': 'Increased activation of H2 receptors', 'D': 'Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells', 'E': 'Increased activity of I cells'}",B,"To determine the mechanism contributing to the changes seen at point D in the graph, we need to understand the physiological processes involved in gastric acid secretion and regulation.

Gastric acid secretion is primarily regulated by the hormone gastrin, which is released by G cells in the stomach in response to various stimuli, including the presence of food in the stomach. Gastrin acts on parietal cells in the stomach to stimulate the secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Option A, increased vagal stimulation, typically leads to increased gastric acid secretion. However, since the question asks about the mechanism at a specific point (D) in the graph, it suggests a more specific regulatory process rather than general stimulation.

Option B, increased activity of D cells, refers to somatostatin-secreting cells that inhibit gastrin release. Increased activity of D cells would result in decreased gastric acid secretion, which does not align with the changes observed at point D.

Option C, increased activation of H2 receptors, is a plausible mechanism. H2 receptors are found on parietal cells and are stimulated by histamine, which is released by enterochromaffin-like cells. Activation of H2 receptors leads to increased gastric acid secretion.

Option D, increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells, would increase the release of histamine, which in turn would stimulate H2 receptors on parietal cells and lead to increased acid secretion. This mechanism could contribute to the changes seen at point D.

Option E, increased activity of I cells, refers to cells that produce the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK primarily stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and bile flow but does not have a direct effect on gastric acid secretion.

Based on the information provided, the most likely mechanism contributing to the changes seen at point D in the graph is the increased activation of H2 receptors on parietal cells, leading to increased gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the answer is C) Increased activation of H2 receptors.",A,False

These findings suggest an acute respiratory condition, possibly due to an inhalation injury or anaphylaxis. The presence of wheezes indicates bronchospasm, which can be treated with bronchodilators. The patient's diaphoresis and constricted pupils may also suggest an anaphylactic reaction, which would be treated differently than an inhalation injury.

Option A, intubation, is typically reserved for patients in respiratory failure or those who cannot protect their airway. This patient has a normal oxygen saturation and is conscious and alert, so intubation is not immediately indicated.

Option B, succinylcholine, is a neuromuscular blocker used during intubation. It is not a treatment for respiratory distress and would not be appropriate in this scenario.

Option C, inhaled ipratropium and oxygen, is a treatment for COPD exacerbations and chronic bronchitis. While ipratropium is a bronchodilator, it is not the first-line treatment for acute bronchospasm due to inhalation injury or anaphylaxis.

Option D, atropine and pralidoxime, is used to treat organophosphate poisoning, which can cause bronchospasm. However, there is no indication that the patient has been exposed to organophosphates, so this is not the most appropriate treatment.

Option E, inhaled albuterol and oxygen, is the best treatment for acute bronchospasm due to asthma, inhalation injury, or anaphylaxis. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist that provides rapid relief of bronchospasm.

Therefore, the answer is E) Inhaled albuterol and oxygen.",A,False
"The first 24 hours after delivery, a 2888 g (6.37 lb) male newborn is not feeding well, has a high-pitched cry, and is diaphoretic. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?","{'A': 'Oral morphine therapy', 'B': 'Oral clonidine therapy', 'C': 'Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy', 'D': 'Oral methimazole therapy', 'E': 'Dextrose infusion'}",A,"The newborn presents with symptoms such as poor feeding, high-pitched cry, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, tremors, and excessive startle response. The mother's frequent use of codeine syrup for a dry cough is significant. Codeine is an opioid and can cross the placenta, potentially causing neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) in the newborn. NOWS symptoms can include those observed in this infant. The infant's vital signs show tachycardia (pulse 165/min), which can be associated with withdrawal. Given the clinical presentation and maternal history, the most appropriate treatment would be to manage the withdrawal symptoms. Oral morphine therapy is the treatment of choice for NOWS. Therefore, the answer is A) Oral morphine therapy.",A,True

A peripheral blood smear reveals spherocytes. The Coombs test is negative. The physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test of this patient’s underlying disorder?","{'A': 'Eosin-5-maleimide binding test', 'B': 'Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59', 'C': 'Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies', 'D': 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'E': 'Liver function tests'}",A,"The patient's presentation of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, a negative Coombs test, scleral icterus, and moderate splenomegaly is suggestive of a hemolytic anemia. The most common causes of hemolytic anemia with these findings include hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, the negative Coombs test makes autoimmune hemolytic anemia less likely.

The most appropriate diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis is the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test (Option A). This test assesses the integrity of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and is typically used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis.

Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 (Option B) is used to diagnose paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is not suggested by the patient's presentation.

Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies (Option C) would be relevant if there was suspicion of a recent infection causing aplastic crisis, which is not indicated here.

A bone marrow biopsy (Option D) is an invasive test and is not the first-line diagnostic tool for hereditary spherocytosis or other hemolytic anemias unless there is suspicion of a primary bone marrow disorder.

Liver function tests (Option E) may be abnormal in hereditary spherocytosis due to increased hemolysis and bilirubin metabolism but are not diagnostic for the condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic test of this patient's underlying disorder is the eosin-5-maleimide binding test. Therefore, the answer is A) Eosin-5-maleimide binding test.",A,True
A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Examination shows erythema with scaling on both cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds and two 1-cm ulcers in the oral cavity. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?,"{'A': 'Decreased lymphocyte count', 'B': 'Increased platelet count', 'C': 'Increased complement component 3', 'D': 'Increased prothrombin time', 'E': 'Decreased gamma globulin'}",A,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, erythema with scaling on both cheeks (malar rash), and oral ulcers are highly suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies and immune complex deposition, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.

In SLE, the following laboratory findings are commonly observed:
- Decreased lymphocyte count due to the immune system's dysfunction.
- Increased platelet count can occur as a reactive process.
- Increased complement component 3 (C3) is not typical in SLE; in fact, complement levels are often decreased due to consumption during immune complex formation.
- Increased prothrombin time is not a characteristic finding in SLE.
- Decreased gamma globulin levels are not typical in SLE; patients often have increased levels due to the production of autoantibodies.

Given these considerations, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient with suspected SLE would be a decreased lymphocyte count.

Therefore, the answer is A) Decreased lymphocyte count.",A,True

The preserved integrity of the ears, nose, and oral mucosa, along with the diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters, are characteristic of scalded skin syndrome (SSS). SSS is a condition commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection, leading to the production of exfoliative toxins that cause blistering and desquamation of the skin. The positive Nikolsky’s sign, where the skin sloughs off easily with slight rubbing, further supports this diagnosis. Scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipela, and pyoderma do not typically present with the widespread blistering and positive Nikolsky’s sign seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B) Scalded skin syndrome.",B,True
A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion in addition to a 1-month history of ankle swelling. She has a history of sleep apnea. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. Cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?,"{'A': 'Localized lymphatic obstruction', 'B': 'Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans', 'C': 'Thrombus formation in a deep vein', 'D': 'Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure', 'E': 'Decreased plasma oncotic pressure\n""'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and ankle swelling, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema, suggest a cardiovascular etiology rather than a localized lymphatic obstruction or dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. The widely split S2 that varies with respiration and the ECG showing right bundle branch block are indicative of right-sided heart failure, which can lead to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure in the lower extremities, causing edema. Thrombus formation in a deep vein (deep vein thrombosis) could also cause edema, but it is less likely in this case due to the absence of risk factors or clinical signs specific to deep vein thrombosis. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure, typically seen in conditions such as liver cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, can also cause edema, but these conditions are not indicated by the patient's history or examination findings. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure due to right-sided heart failure. The answer is D) Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.",D,True

Isopropyl alcohol is an antiseptic that works by denaturing proteins, but it is not typically used as a disinfectant for instruments. Phenol is an antiseptic and disinfectant that also denatures proteins, but it is not primarily known for its oxidizing properties. Povidone-iodine is an iodophor antiseptic that works by releasing iodine to denature proteins, but it is not an oxidizing agent. Benzalkonium chloride is a disinfectant and antiseptic that works by denaturing proteins, but it is not an oxidizing agent either.

Therefore, the answer is A) Chlorine dioxide.",A,True
"A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?","{'A': 'Can form an endospore', 'B': 'Has a rabbit reservoir', 'C': 'Has no cell wall', 'D': 'Is more common in parrot owners', 'E': 'Is transmitted by air conditioning'}",E,"The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea, along with his recent travel history, suggest an infectious etiology. The presence of patchy infiltrates in both lungs on chest radiograph and mild hyponatremia and elevation of AST/ALT levels on labs further supports this. The organism most likely responsible for these symptoms would be one that is associated with respiratory symptoms and can be contracted through environmental exposure, such as from local animals or foods.

Option A (Can form an endospore) is a characteristic of certain bacteria like Clostridium difficile, which is more commonly associated with antibiotic-related diarrhea rather than respiratory symptoms.

Option B (Has a rabbit reservoir) is associated with organisms like Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. While it can cause respiratory symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's presentation and travel history.

Option C (Has no cell wall) refers to viruses, which can cause respiratory symptoms but are less likely to cause the patchy infiltrates seen on the chest radiograph or the mild hyponatremia and elevated liver enzymes.

Option D (Is more common in parrot owners) is associated with Chlamydia psittaci, which causes psittacosis. This is a zoonotic infection that can be acquired from birds, but it is less common and does not fit the patient's presentation as well as another option.

Option E (Is transmitted by air conditioning) refers to Legionella pneumophila, which causes Legionnaires' disease. This bacterium is known to cause pneumonia with gastrointestinal symptoms and can be contracted through contaminated water sources, such as air conditioning cooling towers. Given the patient's symptoms, travel history, and the presence of patchy infiltrates on chest radiograph, Legionella pneumophila is the most likely cause.

Therefore, the answer is E) Is transmitted by air conditioning.",A,False

Three weeks prior to her current symptoms she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 139/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration.

The lack of fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria makes a urinary tract infection less likely. The physical examination findings of tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with dark discoloration are also consistent with an STI.

The options provided are indicative of different pathogens and their associated diagnostic findings:

A. Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain are characteristic of granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), which is a possibility given the patient's symptoms and sexual history.

B. Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain are indicative of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can cause gonorrhea, another STI that presents with genital ulcers and tender lymphadenopathy.

C. PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis would indicate chlamydial infection, which typically presents with cervicitis and urethritis rather than genital ulcers.

D. Positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS are indicative of syphilis, which is a treponemal infection. Primary syphilis typically presents with a painless chancre, while secondary syphilis can present with a variety of systemic symptoms, including generalized lymphadenopathy.

E. Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells is indicative of herpes simplex virus infection, which can cause painful genital ulcers but is less likely to cause the chronic, ulcerative lymphadenopathy described in this patient.

Given the patient's presentation with a painful genital ulcer followed by tender, ulcerative lymphadenopathy without systemic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is granuloma inguinale (donovanosis). Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain would be the finding associated with this condition.

Therefore, the answer is A) Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain.",A,False
"A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide.

If a tRNA is mischarged, the ribosome can often recognize this and will not incorporate the incorrect amino acid into the growing peptide chain. Instead, the ribosome may eject the tRNA or terminate translation. Since the mRNA sequence contains only codons for lysine, and the tRNA is charged with valine instead of lysine, the ribosome will likely recognize this as an error and either eject the tRNA or terminate translation. Therefore, the answer is B) The ribosome will recognize the inappropriately inserted valine residue and terminate protein translation.",B,False
"A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?","{'A': 'Autosomal dominant', 'B': 'Autosomal recessive', 'C': 'Autosomal partial dominance', 'D': 'X-linked dominant', 'E': 'X-linked recessive'}",A,"The patient is a 17-year-old female presenting with shortness of breath, chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing, and hemoptysis (specks of blood on a tissue). The vital signs show tachycardia (pulse 102/min) and hypoxemia (O2 saturation 91% on room air). A large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels is noted, suggesting a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is started on an appropriate treatment, likely anticoagulation, and the effects are monitored using a standard blood test, which returns to normal parameters surprisingly quickly.

Given the rapid response to treatment and the absence of a family history or other suggestive features, this case points towards a provoked PE, possibly due to a paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD). These conditions can lead to a right-to-left shunt, allowing a clot from the venous system to bypass the lung's filtering mechanism and enter the arterial system, causing a PE.

The inheritance pattern for conditions like PFO or ASD is typically sporadic or autosomal dominant, but since there is no mention of a family history, the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is less likely. Autosomal recessive inheritance is less common for these conditions. Autosomal partial dominance, autosomal dominant, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive inheritance patterns are not typically associated with this presentation.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms, considering the mode of inheritance, would be sporadic (not inherited) or autosomal dominant. However, since the question specifically asks for the mode of inheritance and given the lack of family history, the best answer from the provided options would be:

The answer is (A) Autosomal dominant.",A,True
"A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:","{'A': 'Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges', 'B': 'Entrance via cribiform plate', 'C': 'Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons', 'D': 'Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia', 'E': 'Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes'}",C,"The patient's symptoms of acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia, along with the history of flu-like symptoms and recent travel to Mexico, suggest an infectious etiology. The autopsy findings indicating a viral infection point towards an encephalitis. The history of spelunking (cave exploring) is particularly suggestive of a rabies-like virus, which can be transmitted through bats. Rabies virus typically spreads to the CNS through the peripheral nerves after the virus is introduced into the body through bites from infected animals.

The correct answer is C) Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons.",C,True
"A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?","{'A': 'Metformin', 'B': 'Oxybutynin', 'C': 'Metoprolol', 'D': 'Lisinopril', 'E': 'Hydrochlorothiazide'}",B,"The patient is a 95-year-old woman who fell and sustained a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. She is experiencing confusion, which is a new symptom for her. Given her past medical history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, incontinence, and the medications she is taking, we need to determine which medication is most likely associated with her confusion.

Metformin is used for diabetes and does not typically cause confusion. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used for congestive heart failure and hypertension and is not commonly associated with confusion. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic used for hypertension and congestive heart failure and is also not commonly associated with confusion. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for hypertension and heart conditions but is not known to commonly cause confusion.

Oxybutynin, however, is an anticholinergic medication used to treat incontinence. Anticholinergic medications can cause confusion, especially in the elderly, due to their central nervous system effects. Given the patient’s age, her confusion is most likely due to the anticholinergic effects of oxybutynin.

Therefore, the answer is B) Oxybutynin.",B,True

Mumps orchitis is a complication of mumps infection, which is characterized by parotitis (swelling of the parotid gland). Mumps is a viral infection that can be prevented by a live attenuated vaccine. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine.",A,True
"A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of malaise. Two hours prior to presentation, he developed muscle cramps and nausea. He has had 3 episodes of non-bloody watery stools since his symptoms started. He reports that he has experienced similar symptoms multiple times over the past 5 years since he started working at his local zoo as a reptilian caretaker. His medical history is unremarkable. He takes fish oil and a multivitamin daily. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. He is tired-appearing but alert and fully oriented. A stool sample and culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition relies on a virulence factor with which of the following mechanisms of action?","{'A': 'ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2', 'B': 'Binding the Fc region of host immunoglobulins', 'C': 'Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen', 'D': 'Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules', 'E': 'Cleaving lecithin'}",C,"The patient's symptoms, including malaise, muscle cramps, nausea, and watery stools, along with his occupation as a reptilian caretaker at a zoo, suggest an infectious etiology. The sensitivity to bright light could indicate an infection with Helicobacter pylori, which is known to cause gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. However, the stool culture results showing non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli are more consistent with Salmonella species, which are known to cause gastroenteritis. Salmonella relies on a virulence factor known as invasin, which allows the bacteria to invade host cells. Invasin functions by binding to the Fc region of host immunoglobulins, preventing opsonization and phagocytosis by the immune system. Therefore, the answer is B) Binding the Fc region of host immunoglobulins.",B,False
"A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:
Bilirubin
Total 15 mg/dL
Direct 12.3 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L
AST 53 U/L
ALT 45 U/L
γ-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""","{'A': 'Galactosemia', 'B': 'Biliary atresia', 'C': 'Crigler–Najjar syndrome', 'D': 'Breast milk jaundice', 'E': 'Dubin-Johnson syndrome'}",B,"The patient is a 4-week-old female newborn with increasing jaundice for 2 weeks and pale stools for 1 week. She was breastfed but switched to formula feeds recently. Her vital signs are normal, and she appears healthy. The examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice, with the liver palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Serum studies show elevated total bilirubin of 15 mg/dL with a predominantly direct component of 12.3 mg/dL. The alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, and γ-glutamyl transferase levels are also elevated. The blood group is A positive.

The differential diagnosis for neonatal jaundice includes several conditions, but the most likely diagnosis in this case is breast milk jaundice (Option D). Breast milk jaundice typically presents in the first week of life, peaks at 2-3 weeks, and resolves by 6-8 weeks. It is associated with high direct bilirubin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and a palpable liver. The fact that the patient's symptoms started after switching from breastfeeding to formula feeds also supports the diagnosis of breast milk jaundice.

Galactosemia (Option A) is a metabolic disorder that presents with failure to thrive, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and cataracts. Biliary atresia (Option B) typically presents with direct hyperbilirubinemia and a palpable liver, but the alkaline phosphatase level is usually much higher than the other liver enzymes. Crigler–Najjar syndrome (Option C) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Dubin-Johnson syndrome (Option E) is a rare inherited disorder that causes chronic jaundice due to a defect in the ability to secrete conjugated bilirubin into the bile.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is breast milk jaundice. The answer is D) Breast milk jaundice.",A,False

"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?","{'A': 'A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.', 'B': 'A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.', 'C': 'A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.', 'D': 'A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.', 'E': 'A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.'}",E,"The question is asking about the expected result of an experiment where a researcher wants to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions using blotting techniques. HIF-1a is a transcription factor that is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and degraded under normoxic conditions due to hydroxylation by VHL protein. Since the researcher wants to mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia, the expected result is that HIF-1a will be stabilized and present in the cells under normoxic conditions.

Northern blot is used for detecting RNA, while Southern blot is used for detecting DNA. Western blot is used for detecting proteins. Since the question is about detecting HIF-1a, which is a protein, the appropriate technique would be Western blotting.

Therefore, the correct answer is E) A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.",C,False

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?","{'A': 'Yeasts metabolize glucogenic amino acids which are filtered in the urine into glucose', 'B': 'There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules', 'C': 'Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules', 'D': 'There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules', 'E': 'Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate'}",C,"The patient presents with symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss, which are suggestive of diabetes mellitus. The HbA1c of 9% confirms poor glycemic control, and the presence of glucose in the urine (glucosuria) further supports this diagnosis. In diabetes mellitus, the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption can be exceeded, leading to glucosuria. This occurs because the primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules is overwhelmed by the high levels of glucose in the blood. Therefore, the most appropriate option is B) There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules.",A,False

The most likely cause of this obstruction in the context of this patient's history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease is a vascular issue. Renal artery stenosis can lead to hypertension, which is present in this patient, and can also cause back pressure on the kidney leading to dilation of the ureter and renal pelvis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is A) Renal artery stenosis.",A,False
"A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, and a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. His medications include warfarin, enalapril, and amiodarone. His pulse is 85/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails. A CT scan of the chest shows clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung.

The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea is therefore C) Fluid leak into the interstitium and alveoli, which is a characteristic feature of ILD.",C,False
"A previously healthy 52-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining burns over 45% of her body in a house fire. On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?","{'A': 'Decreased prostaglandin synthesis', 'B': 'Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole', 'C': 'Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum', 'D': 'Decreased gastric blood flow', 'E': 'Increased stomach acid production'}",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of burn shock, which is a form of distributive shock. In burn shock, there is widespread capillary dilatation and increased capillary permeability, leading to a significant decrease in intravascular volume. This decrease in intravascular volume can lead to decreased blood flow to various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. The tarry black stools, known as melena, are indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which in this context is most likely due to stress ulcers. Stress ulcers occur as a result of mucosal erosion from the combination of burn shock and the use of aggressive intravenous fluids. The erosion of the mucosa can lead to bleeding.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools is B) Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole.",B,False

It plots serum sodium concentration against extracellular fluid volume. In this patient, the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Since the patient has a history of diarrhea and vomiting, it suggests a loss of sodium and water, which would typically result in a decrease in extracellular fluid volume and a decrease in serum sodium concentration.

Based on the information provided, the most likely substance to show increased secretion in this patient is:

D) Renin

Renin is an enzyme secreted by the kidneys in response to decreased blood volume or decreased renal perfusion. In this case, the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting have likely led to a decrease in extracellular fluid volume, triggering the release of renin to help maintain blood pressure and volume.",D,True
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?","{'A': 'Amitryptiline', 'B': 'Pramipexole', 'C': 'Codeine', 'D': 'Propranolol', 'E': 'Escitalopram'}",B,"The patient's symptoms suggest Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which is characterized by an urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. These symptoms typically occur during periods of rest or inactivity, particularly at night, and are relieved by movement. The patient's family history (her brother has similar symptoms) and the absence of abnormalities on physical examination and laboratory tests support this diagnosis.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for RLS includes dopaminergic agents such as pramipexole (option B). Amitryptiline (option A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can actually worsen RLS symptoms. Codeine (option C) is an opioid that may be used in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment due to the risk of dependence and other side effects. Propranolol (option D) is a beta-blocker and is not indicated for RLS. Escitalopram (option E) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and is also not indicated for RLS; in fact, SSRIs can sometimes worsen RLS symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate option for this patient's symptoms is B) Pramipexole.",A,False
"A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation.

This clinical picture is consistent with a nonviable pregnancy, also known as a missed abortion or missed miscarriage. The absence of fetal cardiac activity is a key finding that indicates nonviability.

The most appropriate next step in management for a nonviable pregnancy at this stage is to evacuate the nonviable pregnancy tissue. The options provided include medical management with Misoprostol (A) or Methotrexate (C), expectant management with follow-up ultrasonography (B), or surgical management with dilation and curettage (D).

Medical management with Misoprostol (A) is typically used for early miscarriage management up to 63 days' gestation. Methotrexate (C) is used for ectopic pregnancies and is not the treatment of choice for a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy. Expectant management with follow-up ultrasonography (B) is an option for some patients, but given the patient's symptoms of bleeding and the findings on ultrasonography, prompt evacuation is more appropriate.

Surgical management with dilation and curettage (D) is the most appropriate next step in this case. It allows for the immediate evacuation of the nonviable pregnancy tissue, which is important given the patient's symptoms and the potential for complications such as infection or hemorrhage.

Therefore, the answer is D) Dilation and curettage.",D,True

The physical examination findings of jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, bilateral basilar crackles, and an S3 gallop suggest the presence of heart failure. The patient's history of emigration from Mexico and visiting his hometown twice a year may be relevant for exposure to certain parasitic infections endemic to that region. Chronic Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite transmitted by triatomine bugs, can lead to cardiomyopathy and heart failure, which fits the patient's presentation. Alcohol abuse and hypertensive changes can also cause heart failure but are less likely given the patient's specific symptoms and history. Myocardial infarction and bacterial infection are less consistent with the patient's presentation and history. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's physical and diagnostic findings is C) Parasitic infection.",C,True

The absence of fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus, or urinary symptoms helps to narrow down the differential diagnosis. The patient's past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease and recent appendicitis, status post laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens.

The patient's vitals are within normal limits, and physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion, suggesting the presence of ascites. Multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied, indicating the presence of spider angiomas. These findings, along with the presence of a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion superior to the pectinate line on anoscopy, are suggestive of portal hypertension, likely secondary to liver cirrhosis.

The fecal occult blood test is negative, which makes significant gastrointestinal bleeding less likely. The vascular protrusion noted on anoscopy is consistent with an internal hemorrhoid, which is a common cause of painless rectal bleeding in the setting of portal hypertension. Internal hemorrhoids typically drain into the superior rectal vein, which is a continuation of the inferior vena cava.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.",B,True

This suggests a sensory pathway lesion. The sensory pathways are located in the thalamus and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Since the patient's motor strength is intact, a motor pathway lesion is less likely. Therefore, the most likely site of impaired perfusion is the structure that is involved in sensory pathways. The parietal lobe is primarily involved in integration of sensory information and spatial orientation, not direct sensory pathways. The lateral medulla is involved in the medial medullary syndrome, which includes sensory deficits but also other symptoms like dysphagia and hoarseness. The basal pons is involved in cranial nerve nuclei and motor pathways, not sensory pathways. The ventral thalamus is part of the sensory relay pathway and is the most likely site of impaired perfusion in this patient. Therefore, the answer is E) Ventral thalamus.",E,True

The physical examination reveals an ataxic gait and the laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level, high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), low platelet count, low total count, low reticulocyte count, and hypersegmented neutrophils. These findings are suggestive of a megaloblastic anemia, which can be caused by either folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. The negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies rule out pernicious anemia, which is a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient’s vegetarian diet puts him at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency because this vitamin is primarily found in animal products. The patient’s symptoms, including neurological manifestations, are more consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency than with folate deficiency, which typically does not cause neurological symptoms. Hypothyroidism and parvovirus infection are less likely to cause the combination of hematologic and neurological findings seen in this patient.

Her blood cultures are now negative, indicating that the infection is being controlled by antibiotics. The laboratory studies show a decrease in leukocyte count from day 1 to day 3, which is a positive sign. Her hemoglobin level has decreased slightly, but this is not alarming. The serum creatinine has decreased from 1.4 mg/dL to 0.9 mg/dL, indicating improved kidney function. Her fasting glucose level is within normal limits. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal, and the free T3 and T4 levels are within the lower end of the normal range, which suggests that her thyroid function is not abnormal.

Given that the patient appears well, with normal temperature, stable cardiovascular status (although still hypotensive), and normal thyroid function tests, the most appropriate treatment is to continue addressing the underlying illness, which in this case is septic shock. The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, and the removal of toxic drugs is not indicated as there is no evidence of drug toxicity. Bromocriptine is used for hyperprolactinemia and certain pituitary tumors, which is not relevant here. Levothyroxine is used for hypothyroidism, which is not indicated in this case.

The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?","{'A': 'Syringomyelia', 'B': 'Spinal metastasis', 'C': 'Herniated disc', 'D': 'Epidural abscess', 'E': 'Spinal hematoma'}",B,"The patient's symptoms of back pain, difficulty walking upstairs, bowel control issues, and neurological findings of bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense suggest a spinal cord pathology. The presence of a hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone on rectal examination are indicative of a possible malignancy involving the spinal cord.

The most likely cause of these symptoms is spinal metastasis (Option B), which refers to the spread of cancer to the spine. This can lead to compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, resulting in the neurological deficits observed. Syringomyelia (Option A) typically presents with a different pattern of sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation, but preservation of touch) and would not explain the bowel control issues or the presence of a mass. Herniated disc (Option C) usually causes localized radicular pain and may not account for the systemic symptoms or the presence of a mass. Epidural abscess (Option D) could cause back pain and neurological deficits, but it is less likely to present with a hard nodular mass and would typically be associated with fever and an elevated white blood cell count. Spinal hematoma (Option E) is less likely given the chronicity of symptoms and the presence of a mass.

Therefore, the answer is B) Spinal metastasis.",A,False
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?","{'A': 'Runs anteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle', 'B': 'Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle', 'C': 'Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle', 'D': 'Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle', 'E': 'Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle'}",E,"The patient's inability to extend the knee (anteriorly) while at 90 degrees of flexion suggests an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The PCL runs from the medial femoral condyle to the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Therefore, the correct answer is E) Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle.",C,False
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of his sense of smell. Two days ago, his mother found that he had left the gas on in the kitchen, and he was unable to smell the odor of the gas. As a child, he was consistently in the 40th percentile for height; now he is in the 15th percentile. He had bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism as an infant. The patient is unable to identify several common odors when presented with them. Physical examination shows sparse axillary and pubic hair and Tanner stage 1 genitals. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition?","{'A': 'Compression of pituitary stalk', 'B': 'Hyperprolactinemia', 'C': 'Impaired migration of GnRH neurons', 'D': 'Sex chromosome trisomy', 'E': 'Decreased thyroxine production'}",C,"The patient's history of being in the 40th percentile for height as a child and now being in the 15th percentile suggests a growth delay that has become more pronounced over time. Additionally, the patient has sparse axillary and pubic hair and Tanner stage 1 genitals, indicating delayed or incomplete pubertal development. These findings suggest a possible hormonal deficiency, particularly involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

The patient's inability to smell the odor of gas and other common odors indicates an impaired sense of smell, which can be associated with a condition known as Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia or hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) due to the failure of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) neurons to migrate properly during embryonic development.

Option C, ""Impaired migration of GnRH neurons,"" aligns with the clinical presentation of delayed puberty, reduced adult height, and anosmia, which are characteristic of Kallmann syndrome. This syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, where there is a deficiency in GnRH secretion leading to low levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and subsequently low levels of sex hormones (testosterone in males).

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is impaired migration of GnRH neurons. The answer is C) Impaired migration of GnRH neurons.",C,True
"A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Asbestosis', 'B': 'Obesity hypoventilation syndrome', 'C': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'D': 'Bronchiectasis', 'E': 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'}",E,"The patient's history of working in a steel mill, combined with his smoking history, suggests exposure to inhalants that could cause lung damage. His symptoms of shortness of breath and weight loss, along with the pulmonary function test results showing an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value, are indicative of an obstructive lung disease. The total lung capacity and residual volume being higher than predicted suggest the presence of air trapping, which is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases. The DLCO of 60% of predicted value indicates a reduced diffusion capacity, which can be seen in emphysema, a type of COPD. Asbestosis would typically show a restrictive pattern, not an obstructive one. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is unlikely given the pulmonary function test results, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually presents with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. Bronchiectasis could present with a chronic cough and recurrent infections, and the pulmonary function test might show an obstructive pattern, but the absence of wheezing and crackles makes it less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",E,True
"A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?","{'A': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system', 'B': 'Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system', 'C': 'Arachidonic acid system', 'D': 'Phosphoinositol system', 'E': 'Tyrosine kinase system'}",D,"The boy has asthma and was experiencing shortness of breath due to exposure to cold air. He declined nebulized albuterol, which is a β2-agonist that works through the cAMP system, because he had experienced palpitations with its use in the past. Instead, the physician prescribed nebulized ipratropium bromide, which is an anticholinergic that works through the muscarinic receptors to cause bronchodilation. The muscarinic receptor pathway is coupled to the phosphoinositol system, which leads to bronchodilation by increasing intracellular calcium and causing smooth muscle relaxation. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Phosphoinositol system.",A,False
"A 9-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother for a routine health checkup. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. He was breastfed for the first 3 months and then switched to cow’s milk and about two months ago she started giving him fruits and vegetables. Family history is noncontributory. Today, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On examination, he has a heartbeat with a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Generally, the boy looks pale. His weight and height fall within the expected range. A complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:
Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 μg/dL
Serum iron: 45 µg/dL
Serum lead: < 5 µg/dL
What is the best treatment for this patient?","{'A': 'Iron supplementation only', 'B': 'Proper diet and iron supplementation', 'C': 'Multivitamins', 'D': 'Proper diet only', 'E': 'Lead chelation therapy'}",B,"The patient is a 9-month-old boy who is generally healthy and meeting developmental milestones. His vital signs are within normal limits. However, his CBC shows a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, which is below the normal range for his age. His MCV is 65 fL, which is low, indicating microcytic anemia. His TIBC is 550 μg/dL and serum iron is 45 µg/dL, both of which are within normal limits. His serum lead level is less than 5 µg/dL, which is normal and rules out lead poisoning.

Given the low hemoglobin and MCV, the anemia is likely due to iron deficiency, which is common in children around this age as they outgrow cow’s milk and start consuming iron-poor foods like fruits and vegetables. The appropriate treatment for iron deficiency anemia is to improve dietary intake of iron and consider iron supplementation.

Therefore, the answer is B) Proper diet and iron supplementation.",B,True
"A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the restrained driver. On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history. His pulse is 93/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 91/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%.

Therefore, the answer is D) Needle decompression.",D,True
"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?","{'A': 'Polyhydramnios', 'B': 'Acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'C': 'Caudal regression syndrome', 'D': 'Meconium aspiration', 'E': 'Placental abruption'}",D,"The patient is a 36-year-old woman who is at 42 weeks' gestation and has a history of two previous pregnancies that resulted in uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation. She is currently presenting for induction of labor. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and her examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent with her gestational age. Given this information, we need to determine which complication her child is at greatest risk for.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) Polyhydramnios - This condition refers to an excessive amount of amniotic fluid. There is no information provided that suggests this patient is at increased risk for polyhydramnios.

B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - ARDS is a severe lung condition that can occur after delivery, but there is no specific information linking this patient's pregnancy to an increased risk of ARDS in her child.

C) Caudal regression syndrome - This is a rare birth defect where the lower (caudal) part of the body does not develop properly. There is no information suggesting that this patient's pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of caudal regression syndrome.

D) Meconium aspiration - This occurs when a newborn inhales a mixture of meconium (the first feces) and amniotic fluid into the lungs around the time of delivery. Risk factors include post-term pregnancy (gestation beyond 42 weeks), which this patient has.

E) Placental abruption - This is a condition where the placental lining separates from the uterus of the mother. While it can occur in any pregnancy, there is no specific information suggesting that this patient is at a particularly high risk for placental abruption.

Based on the information provided, the most likely complication that the child of this patient is at greatest risk for is meconium aspiration. The post-term pregnancy (gestation beyond 42 weeks) is a known risk factor for meconium aspiration.

Therefore, the answer is D) Meconium aspiration.",D,True
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 142 mEq/L
Cl-: 102 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L

Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?","{'A': 'MRI of the adrenal glands', 'B': 'MRI of the chest', 'C': 'MRI of the pituitary gland', 'D': 'Low dose dexamethasone suppression test', 'E': 'Inferior petrosal sinus sampling'}",A,"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, obesity, abdominal striae, and hypertension. The laboratory workup reveals hyperglycemia, elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol, and elevated serum cortisol levels. The serum ACTH level is low, and there is a lack of suppression of cortisol after a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. These findings are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by excessive cortisol production.

The next step in management after confirming hypercortisolism is to determine the cause. The low ACTH level suggests that the cause is not ACTH-dependent, which rules out Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma) as the cause. In Cushing's syndrome, cortisol production is often due to an adrenal tumor or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

An MRI of the adrenal glands (Option A) would be the most appropriate next step to visualize any adrenal tumors or hyperplasia. An MRI of the chest (Option B) would be more appropriate if there was suspicion of an ectopic source of ACTH production, such as a lung tumor, but this is less likely given the low ACTH level. An MRI of the pituitary gland (Option C) would be appropriate if Cushing's disease was suspected, but this is not the case here. A low dose dexamethasone suppression test (Option D) would not be useful as we already know the patient has hypercortisolism. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (Option E) is used to differentiate between a pituitary source and ectopic source of ACTH production, which is not indicated in this case due to the low ACTH level.

Therefore, the answer is A) MRI of the adrenal glands.",A,True
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother. His mother reports multiple instances over the past month when she walked into his room while he was masturbating. She is worried he may be going through some sort of “problem.” He is currently in 9th grade; his mother says that he is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

He is otherwise healthy, involved in sports, and doing reasonably well in school. Masturbation is a normal and common behavior for adolescents. There is no indication from the information provided that the patient is experiencing any physical or psychological abnormalities. The mother's concern may be due to a lack of understanding about the normalcy of masturbation. The most appropriate next step would be to reassure the mother that masturbation is a normal part of adolescent development and provide information about the normalcy and potential benefits of masturbation, such as stress relief and sexual satisfaction within a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer is D) Reassure the mother.",D,True
"A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Tyrosine', 'B': 'Pyridoxine', 'C': 'Thiamine', 'D': 'Tetrahydrobiopterin', 'E': 'Niacin'}",D,"The patient has phenylketonuria (PKU), which is a metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize phenylalanine due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor. The symptoms described, including persistent head lag, blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia, are consistent with the complications of untreated PKU. The markedly elevated serum prolactin level is also a clue, as phenylalanine normally inhibits prolactin release, and in PKU, high levels of phenylalanine can lead to hyperprolactinemia.

The special diet for PKU typically restricts phenylalanine, and supplementation with tetrahydrobiopterin can help restore the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, thereby preventing further complications of PKU.

Therefore, the answer is D) Tetrahydrobiopterin.",D,True
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by staff of the group home where he resides because of worsening confusion for the past week.

The laboratory findings of a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration suggest the diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In SIADH, the excessive release of ADH leads to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia.

In SIADH, serum osmolality is decreased because of the dilutional effect of the retained water. Urine sodium is low because of the body's attempt to conserve sodium in the setting of hyponatremia. Serum aldosterone is typically normal in SIADH because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is not activated in response to volume depletion.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The answer is A) ↑ normal normal.",A,False
"A 63-year-old female complains of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%.

The presence of neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear is indicative of a megaloblastic anemia. The patient's decreased position sense and loss in vibratory sensation in the lower extremities suggest a possible vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.

The patient's past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition, increases the likelihood of another autoimmune condition, such as pernicious anemia, which is associated with anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption.

The pathogenesis of neonatal sepsis often involves an infection transmitted from the mother to the infant during delivery. This can be due to various organisms, with Group B Streptococcus being one of the most common. The infection leads to a systemic inflammatory response in the infant, which can manifest as the symptoms described.

The answer is not provided directly in the question, but based on the clinical presentation and common pathogens involved in neonatal sepsis, the most likely mechanism of disease is the destruction of Schwann cells (Option C). This is because Group B Streptococcus, a common cause of neonatal sepsis, can release beta-hemolysin toxin, which has been shown to cause destruction of Schwann cells, leading to peripheral neuropathy.

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?""
""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

This condition is characterized by a hypermetabolic state triggered by certain anesthetic agents, leading to a rapid increase in body temperature and severe muscle contractions. The patient's use of phenytoin and propranolol does not directly suggest malignant hyperthermia, but it is important to note that these medications can increase the risk of developing this condition when combined with anesthetic agents. Exertional heat stroke is less likely given the patient's occupation and the absence of recent physical exertion. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome typically presents with hyperthermia, altered mental status, and generalized muscle rigidity, but the patient's recent anesthesia history points more towards malignant hyperthermia. Status epilepticus would present with continuous seizure activity rather than altered mental status and hyperthermia. Thyroid storm could present with hyperthermia and tachycardia, but the recent anesthesia and the specific combination of symptoms make malignant hyperthermia a more likely diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is B) Malignant hyperthermia.",B,False
"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband.

The patient and her husband have been informed of the risks of transfer and still insist on being transferred to a more capable center.

Given the patient's unstable condition, it is not appropriate to allow the family to leave in their car (option A) or to decline admission and refer the patient to the closest capable emergency department (option B). Disregarding the patient's request and treating until delivery is complete (option C) is also not appropriate, as it ignores the patient's autonomy and right to make decisions about her own care.

The most appropriate next step in management is to treat the patient and transfer her after she makes a written request (option D). This option respects the patient's autonomy and ensures that her wishes are documented. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the transfer is done safely, taking into consideration the risks associated with the patient's condition.",A,False
"A 37-year-old woman presents to the clinic with pain and swelling of her legs. She states that she first noticed the swelling 6 weeks ago.

She is started on an immunosuppressant, likely another medication for SLE, and then develops blood in her urine. The urinalysis shows erythrocytes but is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or crystals. Cystoscopy reveals diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization. These findings suggest a diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis, which can be a side effect of certain medications.

Among the options provided, ifosfamide (A) and cyclophosphamide are alkylating agents used in chemotherapy and can cause hemorrhagic cystitis. Mesna (B) is used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis in patients receiving ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide. Methotrexate (C) is an immunosuppressant used in the treatment of SLE, but it does not typically cause hemorrhagic cystitis. Nitrofurantoin (D) is an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections and can also cause hemorrhagic cystitis, but it is not typically used as an immunosuppressant for SLE. Prednisone (E) is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation in SLE but does not cause hemorrhagic cystitis.

Given that the patient was started on an immunosuppressant and developed hemorrhagic cystitis, the most likely agent is one that can cause this side effect. Ifosfamide is known to cause hemorrhagic cystitis, and mesna is used to prevent it. Therefore, the answer is B) Mesna.",B,True

This is indicated by her age, the location of pain (joint-related), morning stiffness that resolves relatively quickly, worsening pain with activity, and the absence of a history of trauma. Osteoarthritis is also associated with obesity, which is indicated by the patient's BMI of 31.8 kg/m2. The presence of crepitus and pain with full flexion and extension further supports this diagnosis.

The serum uric acid concentration is not elevated, making gout less likely. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is mildly elevated, which can be seen in osteoarthritis but is also non-specific.

Given the clinical presentation and the examination findings, the most likely imaging finding would be osteophytes (bone spurs) and joint-space narrowing on x-ray, which are characteristic of osteoarthritis.

Therefore, the answer is A) Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.",A,True
"A 42-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician for intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has not seen a doctor since he became uninsured 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. The liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1–2 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N ≥ 500 mm3).

The patient's PPD skin test result of 4 mm of induration suggests a previous or current tuberculosis (TB) infection but is not sufficient to diagnose active TB in the context of his immunocompromised state.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is common in patients with AIDS when the CD4+ count falls below 50/mm3. The appropriate treatment for disseminated MAC infection includes a combination of antimycobacterial agents such as azithromycin and ethambutol.

Therefore, the answer is D) Azithromycin and ethambutol.",D,True
"A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a cough, dyspnea, and fever for 1 day. The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1°C (103.1°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?","{'A': 'Ceftriaxone and azithromycin', 'B': 'Ertapenem', 'C': 'Colistin', 'D': 'Cefepime and levofloxacin', 'E': 'Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate'}",D,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia, including cough, dyspnea, fever, and productive cough with green phlegm. The presence of a left upper-lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray further supports this diagnosis. The patient's vital signs indicate that he is tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive, and he has hypoxemia, which suggests a severe infection and systemic response. The presence of gram-negative rods on the endotracheal aspirate Gram stain indicates that the pneumonia is likely caused by gram-negative bacteria.

Given the patient's history of chemotherapy, he is at increased risk for infections with resistant organisms. The choice of antibiotics should cover the most likely pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common gram-negative pathogen in patients with malignancy and those with chronic lung diseases such as COPD.

Option A (Ceftriaxone and azithromycin) is typically used for community-acquired pneumonia, but may not cover Pseudomonas. Option C (Colistin) is a last-resort antibiotic for multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria and is not typically used as monotherapy. Option E (Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate) is more commonly used for atypical pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia without severe features. Option D (Cefepime and levofloxacin) provides broad-spectrum coverage, including activity against Pseudomonas, and is appropriate for severe hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Considering the patient's severe presentation and risk factors for multi-drug resistant pathogens, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be one that covers a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas.

Therefore, the answer is D) Cefepime and levofloxacin.",A,False

For the last 10 years, he drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. He occasionally takes pantoprazole for heartburn. He is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis; transillumination test is negative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?","{'A': 'Leydig cell tumor', 'B': 'Obesity', 'C': 'Thyroid disease', 'D': 'Klinefelter syndrome', 'E': 'Trauma to testis'}",A,"The patient is a 32-year-old man presenting with progressive development of tender breast tissue (gynecomastia) over the past 18 months. He has also gained weight and has a history of occasional beer consumption and use of pantoprazole for heartburn. His BMI is 30 kg/m2, indicating obesity. The patient had a testicular injury 3 months ago but the mass in the testis does not transilluminate, which is suggestive of a solid rather than cystic mass.

Gynecomastia can be associated with several conditions, including hormonal imbalances, certain medications, and systemic diseases. In this case, the most likely underlying cause is related to the patient's obesity. Obesity can lead to increased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue, resulting in gynecomastia. The patient's history of beer consumption and use of pantoprazole are less likely to be the primary cause of his gynecomastia, as these are not typically associated with significant hormonal changes leading to breast tissue development.

Leydig cell tumors are a type of testicular tumor that can cause hormonal imbalances but would not be the most likely cause given the patient's presentation and the lack of other signs or symptoms suggestive of a hormone-secreting tumor.

Thyroid disease can cause menstrual irregularities and other systemic symptoms, but it is not typically associated with gynecomastia in men.

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males. It can lead to gynecomastia, but the patient's presentation does not strongly suggest this diagnosis, and there are no other features typical of Klinefelter syndrome mentioned, such as small testes or infertility.

Trauma to the testis can cause pain and swelling but is not typically associated with the development of gynecomastia.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's gynecomastia is obesity. The answer is B) Obesity.",B,False

"A healthy 23-year-old male is undergoing an exercise stress test as part of his physiology class. If blood were to be sampled at different locations before and after the stress test, which area of the body would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points?","{'A': 'Superior vena cava', 'B': 'Inferior vena cava', 'C': 'Coronary sinus', 'D': 'Pulmonary artery', 'E': 'Pulmonary vein'}",C,"The oxygen content in the blood is highest in the pulmonary vein, as this is where oxygenated blood returns from the lungs. During exercise, oxygen consumption increases, and more oxygen is delivered to the tissues. The oxygen content in the blood will decrease in the venous system and increase in the arterial system. Among the options given, the Superior vena cava and Inferior vena cava are both large veins that carry deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart, so either could potentially have the lowest oxygen content. However, since the question asks for the area that contains the lowest oxygen content at both before and after the stress test, we should consider the location where blood deoxygenation occurs. The Coronary sinus is a vein that drains the heart muscle and is not typically involved in significant oxygen exchange or deoxygenation. The Pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation, so it would not have the lowest oxygen content after the stress test. The Pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, so it would not have the lowest oxygen content before or after the stress test. Based on this information, the Superior vena cava and Inferior vena cava are both likely to have the lowest oxygen content at both time points. Since the question does not specify which location within the vena cava system, we cannot select a specific answer. However, if we must choose one, the Superior vena cava is more centrally located and typically represents the overall systemic venous oxygen content. Therefore, the answer is A) Superior vena cava.",A,False

Given the absence of endometrial atypia or invasion, the patient's bleeding is likely due to atrophic changes associated with menopause rather than endometrial cancer or high-risk hyperplasia. Therefore, aggressive treatments such as total hysterectomy (A), progestin therapy (D), or surgical endometrial ablation (E) are not indicated. Estrogen vaginal cream (B) can be used to treat vaginal atrophy but does not address the heavy bleeding.

The most appropriate next step in management is to provide reassurance and follow-up (C). The patient should be monitored for any changes in symptoms or findings on subsequent evaluations.",A,False
"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?","{'A': 'Cytomegalovirus', 'B': 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'C': 'Human immunodeficiency virus', 'D': 'Rotavirus', 'E': 'Vaccinia virus'}",D,"The question describes a process where a host cell is co-infected with two viruses from the same family, resulting in the production of a novel virus particle with a unique genome. This process is known as genetic reassortment, which is a common mechanism for the emergence of new influenza virus strains. Among the options provided, the virus known to undergo genetic reassortment is the Influenza virus, which is not listed explicitly in the options. However, since the question is about the emergence of a virulent strain and the process described is similar to genetic reassortment, we can infer that the virus capable of undergoing such a process would be one that is known to reassort its genome segments. Influenza viruses (both A and B types) are known for this phenomenon. None of the viruses listed in the options (A, B, C, D, E) are specifically known for genetic reassortment, but the closest match based on the process described would be E) Vaccinia virus, as it belongs to the Poxviridae family, which has a segmented genome that can undergo recombination. However, this is not a classic example of genetic reassortment as seen in influenza viruses. Therefore, the answer is E) Vaccinia virus.",E,False
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of facial swelling that started 5 days ago. Two weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved spontaneously. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 94/67 mm Hg. Examination shows pitting edema of the upper and lower extremities as well as periorbital edema. The abdomen is mildly distended. Laboratory studies show:

A renal biopsy of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?""","{'A': 'Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy', 'B': 'Subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy', 'C': 'Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluoresence', 'D': 'Normal light microscopy findings', 'E': 'Effacement of foot processes of podocytes on light microscopy'}",D,"The patient presents with facial swelling, pitting edema of the extremities, and periorbital edema following a recent sore throat. The laboratory findings of hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.1 g/dL), hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 270 mg/dL), and proteinuria (protein 4+) are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome.

The renal biopsy findings in nephrotic syndrome can vary depending on the underlying cause. However, the most common findings in children with nephrotic syndrome are minimal changes on light microscopy (Option D) and effacement of foot processes of podocytes on electron microscopy (Option E).

Given the patient's age and the recent history of a sore throat, the most likely diagnosis is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which typically presents with low complement levels (C3 in particular) and would show mesangial proliferation on light microscopy (Option A) and subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy (Option B). However, these findings are not consistent with the classic presentation of nephrotic syndrome.

Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence (Option C) would be indicative of a type of glomerulonephritis like lupus nephritis or anti-GBM disease, which are less likely in this clinical scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings is E) Effacement of foot processes of podocytes on light microscopy, which is characteristic of minimal change disease, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.",A,False
"A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Artery of Sampson', 'B': 'Ovarian artery', 'C': 'Superior vesical artery', 'D': 'Uterine artery', 'E': 'Inferior vesical artery'}",D,"The patient developed left-sided flank pain and oliguria with an increase in serum creatinine postoperatively. This clinical picture is suggestive of a complication related to the urinary system, likely due to ischemia from vessel ligation. The renal ultrasound being normal rules out obstruction or stones as the cause of hematuria. The urinalysis showing hematuria along with the clinical signs points towards a ureteric injury or ischemia.

The uterine artery is known to supply the ureteric artery, which is a branch of the uterine artery that runs close to the ureter. Ligation of the uterine artery can therefore lead to ischemia of the ureter, resulting in the symptoms described. The other vessels listed (A, B, C, and E) are not typically associated with this complication.

Therefore, the answer is D) Uterine artery.",D,True

This condition is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, or in individuals with altered oral flora, such as competitive swimmers who frequently use chlorinated water. The presence of a bitter metallic taste is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The most appropriate treatment for oral candidiasis is an antifungal medication. The mechanism of action of antifungal medications includes inhibition of ergosterol synthesis. Ergosterol is a key component of fungal cell membranes, and its synthesis is crucial for fungal cell survival.

Among the options provided, the mechanism of action that corresponds to the treatment of oral candidiasis is:

C) Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase

This mechanism of action is characteristic of azole antifungals, which inhibit the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, leading to the accumulation of methyl sterols and disruption of ergosterol synthesis in fungal cells. This ultimately results in fungal cell death.

Levothyroxine works by replacing the deficient thyroid hormone, which then acts on various cellular targets in the body. The thyroid hormone primarily targets the nucleus of cells and influences gene transcription. However, since the question asks for the cellular target of the medicine (levothyroxine), which is the precursor to thyroid hormone, we need to consider the cellular targets of thyroid hormones.

Among the options provided, the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters in the membranes of epithelial cells in the ascending loop of Henle (option E) are known to be regulated by thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones increase the activity of this transporter, which is important for the reabsorption of sodium and chloride and the secretion of potassium in the kidney.

This timing suggests that the pain is related to her menstrual cycle. The fact that she has been taking ibuprofen, which has provided some relief, supports the idea that the pain is due to a process that involves prostaglandins, as NSAIDs like ibuprofen inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins are involved in endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions. The regularity of her menstrual cycle and the absence of abnormalities on physical examination make hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumors of the myometrium (option E) and ascending infections (option B) less likely. While ovarian cysts (option C) could cause pelvic pain, the cyclical nature of the pain is more suggestive of a process related to the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy (option D) is unlikely given the regularity of her cycles and the fact that she uses condoms, although not consistently.

"A 66-year-old woman presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. She reports that she has not urinated for the past 2 days and that the urine leakage occurs during both day and night and is not associated with physical exertion. The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4℃ (97.5℉). The physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder that is palpated in the suprapubic region. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation. On gynecologic examination, the cervix was normally positioned, mobile, and without any visible lesions. Bulging of the posterior vaginal wall was noted. The adnexa were not palpable. An ultrasound examination showed an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities. Which of the following is  the next step in managing this patient?","{'A': 'Installing a vaginal pessary', 'B': 'Bladder catheterization', 'C': 'Cystostomy', 'D': 'Prescribing bethanechol', 'E': 'Prescribing prostaglandin E2'}",B,"The patient presents with urinary retention, as evidenced by her inability to urinate for the past 2 days and the palpable distended urinary bladder on physical examination. The symptoms of difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region further support this. Urinary incontinence in this context is likely due to overflow incontinence secondary to bladder outlet obstruction.

The patient's medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression, along with the physical examination findings of decreased Achilles reflexes and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation, suggest a possible neurogenic cause for her urinary retention. However, the presence of bulging of the posterior vaginal wall may also indicate a pelvic organ prolapse contributing to the bladder outlet obstruction.

Given the acute presentation and the patient's inability to void for 2 days, immediate intervention is required to relieve the bladder distention and prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections or bladder damage.

Option A (Installing a vaginal pessary) is not appropriate as it is typically used for pelvic organ prolapse and would not address the immediate issue of bladder distention.

Option B (Bladder catheterization) is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient. It will provide immediate relief of the bladder distention by draining the urine.

Option C (Cystostomy) is a more invasive procedure and is not the first-line treatment for acute urinary retention.

Option D (Prescribing bethanechol) is used to treat urinary retention by stimulating bladder contraction, but it is not the appropriate choice in this case as the patient is unable to void despite having an overdistended bladder, suggesting a mechanical obstruction that needs to be relieved first.

Option E (Prescribing prostaglandin E2) is used for erectile dysfunction and does not have a role in the management of urinary retention.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) Bladder catheterization.",A,False
"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?","{'A': 'Doxycycline', 'B': 'Ciprofloxacin', 'C': 'Erythromycin', 'D': 'Piperacillin', 'E': 'Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time'}",A,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute exacerbation of COPD, which is characterized by increased cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing. The presence of fever and greenish-yellow sputum suggests a possible respiratory infection, which is a common precipitant of acute exacerbations in COPD patients. The patient's history of COPD, along with the acute presentation and physical examination findings, indicate that an acute exacerbation of COPD is likely.

In the management of an acute exacerbation of COPD, antibiotics are considered when there is a suspected bacterial infection, which seems to be the case here given the patient's fever and purulent sputum. Oral prednisone has already been started, which is appropriate for reducing inflammation in the airways.

Considering the options provided, the most appropriate antibiotic choice would be one that covers common pathogens associated with respiratory infections in COPD patients. Doxycycline (A) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic but is not typically the first choice for community-acquired respiratory infections. Ciprofloxacin (B) is a fluoroquinolone with good coverage against respiratory pathogens and could be considered in patients with penicillin allergy. Erythromycin (C) is a macrolide antibiotic that has activity against respiratory pathogens and could be used in patients with penicillin allergy. Piperacillin (D) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic often used for hospital-acquired infections and is not typically used as first-line therapy for community-acquired respiratory infections in COPD patients.

Given the patient's presentation and the need for an antibiotic that covers common respiratory pathogens, the most appropriate option would be either ciprofloxacin (B) or erythromycin (C). Since the patient has no known allergies to medications, either could be considered. However, ciprofloxacin may be preferred due to its broader spectrum of activity.

Therefore, the answer is B) Ciprofloxacin.",B,False
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago. The complete blood count showed leukocytosis. Anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showed a gram-negative pathogen.

This description is consistent with ventricular fibrillation (VF), a life-threatening heart rhythm that results in a rapid, erratic heartbeat. The patient has already received two attempts at defibrillation and 1 mg of IV epinephrine, which are initial steps in the management of VF. However, the patient remains pulseless and hypotensive (blood pressure 60/35 mm Hg).

The next step in management should be the administration of a medication that can help to stabilize the heart rhythm and improve cardiac output. Among the options provided:

A. Sotalol is a beta-blocker and antiarrhythmic medication, but it is not typically used in the acute setting of VF.
B. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used in the treatment of VF, but it is not the first-line medication in this scenario.
C. Epinephrine is a vasopressor and inotropic agent that is commonly used during cardiac arrest to increase coronary artery perfusion and improve cardiac output.
D. Dopamine is a vasopressor and inotropic agent, but it is not the first-line medication for VF during cardiac arrest.
E. Atropine is used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate), not tachycardia (fast heart rate) as seen in VF.

Given that the patient has already received epinephrine and still remains pulseless, the most appropriate next step in management would be to continue with the administration of epinephrine to support the heart's function and improve perfusion.

Therefore, the answer is C) Epinephrine.",C,False

He also has a history of smoking and drinking alcohol, which are risk factors for vascular disease. The presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck suggests the possibility of carotid artery stenosis, which could be causing the symptoms in his left hand due to decreased blood flow to the brain. The most appropriate next step in management would be to further evaluate the carotid arteries.

Option A (Ultrasonography of the neck) is a non-invasive test that can assess the carotid arteries for stenosis. It is commonly used as an initial screening tool for carotid artery disease.

Option B (Echocardiography) is useful for evaluating cardiac structure and function but is not indicated based on the information provided.

Option C (Warfarin therapy) is an anticoagulant used for preventing thromboembolic events, but there is no current indication for its use in this patient.

Option D (CT angiography of the head) could provide detailed images of the cerebral vasculature, but it is not the most appropriate initial test for suspected carotid artery disease.

Option E (Digital subtraction angiography of the neck) is an invasive procedure used to visualize blood vessels and is typically reserved for cases where non-invasive tests are inconclusive or when planning for possible interventions.

Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a non-invasive ultrasonography of the neck to assess for carotid artery stenosis. Therefore, the answer is A) Ultrasonography of the neck.",A,True
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized rash for 3 days. During this period, he has had severe itching and was not able to sleep well. He has also had fever, headache, and some muscle pain. Five days ago, he had a runny nose which subsided with over-the-counter medications. He returned from a camping trip 1 week ago.

The rash includes macules, papules, crusted lesions, and fluid-filled vesicles. The absence of cervical lymphadenopathy is notable. The patient's recent camping trip and attendance at daycare are relevant epidemiological factors.

Let's consider the options:

A. Measles typically presents with a high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots, followed by a generalized maculopapular rash. The absence of respiratory symptoms and the presence of vesicles make measles less likely.

B. Urushiol-induced dermatitis, such as that caused by poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac, can cause an itchy rash with papules and vesicles. However, it is less likely to cause systemic symptoms such as fever and muscle pain.

C. Scarlet fever is associated with a sore throat, fever, and a sandpaper-like rash, typically without vesicles. The absence of cervical lymphadenopathy and the presence of vesicles make scarlet fever less likely.

D. Chickenpox is characterized by a pruritic rash that progresses from macules to papules to vesicles and then crusts. It often starts on the face and trunk and spreads to the rest of the body. Fever, headache, and muscle pain are common systemic symptoms. The presence of vesicles and the patient's symptoms are consistent with chickenpox.

E. Rubella, also known as German measles, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy, particularly behind the ears and at the base of the skull. The absence of lymphadenopathy and the presence of vesicles make rubella less likely.

Based on the clinical presentation and the characteristic rash with vesicles, the most likely diagnosis is chickenpox. Therefore, the answer is D) Chickenpox.",D,True
"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks.

The fact that the symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while is also characteristic of angina. The absence of abnormalities on the physical examination, chest x-ray, and ECG, as well as normal serum cardiac markers, suggest that she does not have an acute coronary syndrome.

Given this clinical scenario, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform a myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress (Option A). This test can help assess the presence and extent of myocardial ischemia by evaluating the perfusion of the heart muscle during stress, which in this case can be achieved pharmacologically since the patient is unable to exercise due to her physical limitations.

Therefore, the answer is A) Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.",A,True

The elevated temperature indicates the presence of an infection. The normal levels of total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase make hepatocellular damage or cholestasis less likely.

Option A, autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma, typically presents with epigastric pain that may radiate to the back and is associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are not mentioned in the question stem.

Option B, hypomotility of the gallbladder, also known as biliary dyskinesia, could present with similar symptoms but is less likely in the presence of fever and inconclusive ultrasonography findings.

Option C, a fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine, would likely present with more severe symptoms, such as pneumobilia or air in the biliary tree on imaging, which is not described in the question stem.

Option D, infection with a hepatotropic virus, would typically present with elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), which are within normal limits in this patient.

Option E, obstruction of the cystic duct, is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. The obstruction can lead to distention of the gallbladder, which can cause right upper quadrant pain and tenderness. The presence of fever suggests an infectious process, such as cholecystitis.

Therefore, the answer is E) Obstruction of the cystic duct.",A,False

The skin and radial pulse are intact, and there are no sensory abnormalities in the right upper limb. Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a clavicular fracture.

The appropriate management for a clavicular fracture depends on the type and severity of the fracture. In most cases, conservative treatment with a shoulder sling or immobilization is sufficient, especially for nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures. Surgical intervention, such as tension banding or plate application, may be considered for displaced fractures or if conservative treatment fails.

Given that the question does not specify the type or displacement of the fracture, the most appropriate next step would typically be to apply a simple shoulder sling to allow the arm to rest and heal. This would provide support and limit movement, facilitating the healing process.

Therefore, the answer is C) Apply a simple shoulder sling.",C,True

The CT scan of the head would help in identifying the cause. Given the patient's history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia, he is at high risk for cerebrovascular disease.

Warfarin therapy (A) is used for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves to prevent thromboembolic events, which is not indicated in this case.

Vitamin E therapy (B) has been used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but it is not the primary treatment for dementia and does not address the underlying cause.

Cerebral shunting (C) is a surgical procedure used to treat normal-pressure hydrocephalus, which is not indicated here without evidence of ventricular enlargement.

Tetrabenazine therapy (D) is used for the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders such as Huntington's disease, which does not fit the clinical picture.

Cognitive training (E) is a non-pharmacological intervention that can improve cognitive function in patients with dementia. It is a reasonable approach to manage symptoms of dementia, especially in the absence of a reversible cause.

The presence of crackles at both lung bases and an oxygen saturation of 82% on room air further supports this diagnosis. The undetectable fibrinogen concentration indicates a consumptive coagulopathy, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can occur secondary to massive pulmonary embolism. The hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL suggests significant blood loss, which in the context of this clinical scenario is likely due to placental abruption. Placental abruption can lead to the release of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation, resulting in the clinical picture seen in this patient. This condition is known as amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFE is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency that occurs when amniotic fluid, fetal material, or both enter the maternal circulation, leading to cardiovascular collapse, hypoxia, and coagulopathy.

These results indicate that the patient has anemia with a low MCV (microcytic anemia).

The presence of a positive fluid wave suggests splenomegaly, which can be associated with conditions that cause extravascular hemolysis, such as gout. The depapillated dorsal surface of the tongue and erythematous swollen patches at the oral commissures are signs of glossitis and stomatitis, which are often seen in alcohol abuse.

Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of microcytic anemia, the most likely finding on a peripheral blood smear would be hypochromatic erythrocytes (Option D). Hypochromic erythrocytes result from the loss of hemoglobin and are commonly seen in alcohol-related liver disease, which can lead to ineffective erythropoiesis and iron utilization.

Option A, HER2, is a gene that can be overexpressed in breast cancer cells. HER2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and is involved in cell growth and division. Overexpression of HER2 is associated with a more aggressive form of breast cancer.

Option B, TP53, is a tumor suppressor gene that helps regulate cell division and prevent cancer formation. Mutations in TP53 are common in many types of cancer, but it is not typically associated with overexpression in breast cancer.

Option C, BCR-ABL, is a fusion gene that is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is not associated with breast cancer.

Option D, BRCA-2, is a gene that produces a protein involved in DNA repair. Mutations in BRCA-2 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but overexpression of BRCA-2 is not a characteristic of breast cancer cells.

Option E, BCL-2, is a gene that produces a protein involved in preventing cell death. Overexpression of BCL-2 can be found in certain types of cancer, including some breast cancers, but it is not the most common genetic alteration associated with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.

Based on the information provided, the most likely gene to be overexpressed in this patient's breast cancer cells is HER2. Therefore, the answer is A) HER2.",A,True
"After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?","{'A': 'Double-negative pro-T cell', 'B': 'Pre-T cell', 'C': 'Double-positive T cell', 'D': 'Single-positive CD4+ T cell', 'E': 'Single-positive CD8+ T cell'}",C,The answer is C) Double-positive T cell.,C,True
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care ward due to progressive dyspnea, cough with pink sputum, and diaphoresis. He had 2 myocardial infarctions at the age of 66 and 69 years and suffers from chronic heart failure. At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5°C (95.9°F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?","{'A': 'Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining', 'B': ""Areas with 'ghost cells' surrounded by macrophages in the cardiac tissue"", 'C': 'Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue', 'D': 'Ground-glass hepatocytes', 'E': 'Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue'}",A,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure, as evidenced by symptoms of dyspnea, pink sputum (indicative of pulmonary edema), diaphoresis, hypotension, tachycardia, and the presence of an S3 heart sound and a systolic murmur. The patient's history of chronic heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions further support this diagnosis. The development of ventricular fibrillation and subsequent death is a common complication of acute decompensated heart failure.

Given the clinical scenario, the most likely microscopic finding on autopsy would be related to the complications of chronic heart failure and acute decompensation. Let's evaluate the options:

A. Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining - This finding is characteristic of pulmonary hemosiderosis or heart failure, where iron is deposited in the lungs due to repeated episodes of pulmonary edema and subsequent hemorrhage.

B. Areas with 'ghost cells' surrounded by macrophages in the cardiac tissue - This finding is typical of myocardial infarction, where dead cardiac cells (ghost cells) are phagocytosed by macrophages.

C. Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue - Prussian-blue staining is used to detect iron deposition, which can be seen in conditions like hemochromatosis or chronic transfusion therapy, not typically associated with acute decompensated heart failure.

D. Ground-glass hepatocytes - This finding is associated with liver pathology, such as hepatic congestion or hepatitis, and is not specific to heart failure.

E. Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue - Congo-red staining is used to detect amyloidosis, a condition where amyloid protein deposits in various tissues, including the heart. It is not related to acute decompensated heart failure.

Based on the patient's presentation and the most likely complications of chronic heart failure, the most appropriate option is A) Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining, which",A,True
"A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F).

The most common congenital heart defect that presents with these findings is an atrial septal defect (ASD). In a patient with an ASD, the left-to-right shunt leads to increased blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. During pregnancy, there is an increase in blood volume and cardiac output to meet the increased demands of the maternal body. This increase in blood volume and cardiac output can exacerbate the left-to-right shunt in patients with an ASD, leading to symptoms such as dyspnea and dizziness. Therefore, the physiological change in pregnancy that is causing a change in this patient’s condition is an increase in cardiac output. The answer is D) Increase in cardiac output.",D,False
"A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?","{'A': '25/250', 'B': '250/25', 'C': '190/250', 'D': '165/250', 'E': '355/500'}",B,"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we use the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and then calculate its reciprocal. The ARR is calculated by subtracting the event rate of the control group from the event rate of the treatment group.

From the information provided:
- The number of participants cured in the study treatment group is 190.
- The number of participants cured in the control group is 165.
- The total number of participants in both groups is 500.

First, we calculate the cure rate for both groups:
- Cure rate in the study treatment group = (number of cured participants / total number of participants in the study treatment group) = 190 / 250 = 0.76
- Cure rate in the control group = (number of cured participants / total number of participants in the control group) = 165 / 250 = 0.66

Next, we calculate the ARR:
- ARR = cure rate of the study treatment group - cure rate of the control group = 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.1

Now, we calculate the NNT:
- NNT = 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.1 = 10

The most appropriate treatment for allergic conjunctivitis is the use of topical anti-allergic agents. Among the options provided, ketotifen eye drops (B) are specifically indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. They act as a mast cell stabilizer and also have anti-inflammatory properties. Erythromycin ointment (A) is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate for allergic conjunctivitis. Warm compresses (C) may provide symptomatic relief but do not treat the underlying allergy. Fluorometholone eye drops (D) are corticosteroids and are not the first-line treatment for allergic conjunctivitis due to potential side effects.

"A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She reports sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain that started 1 hour ago. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a prior myocardial infarction requiring a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, atorvastatin, and insulin. She is retired and lives a sedentary lifestyle at home. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 109/68 mmHg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min. Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy.

A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient?","{'A': 'Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor', 'B': 'Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor', 'C': 'Beta-1 adrenergic receptor', 'D': 'Beta-2 adrenergic receptor', 'E': 'D2 receptor'}",C,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI), as evidenced by the ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6 on the electrocardiogram. The patient's hemodynamic status has deteriorated, with hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting cardiogenic shock likely secondary to the acute MI. In this setting, the most appropriate medication would be one that increases cardiac output and improves blood pressure.

The options given are medications that primarily stimulate different types of adrenergic receptors or a dopamine receptor. The alpha-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation leads to vasoconstriction, which would increase blood pressure but may not be the best choice in this scenario due to the risk of further myocardial ischemia. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation generally leads to decreased sympathetic outflow and would not be appropriate in this acute setting. Beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation increases heart rate and contractility, which can improve cardiac output and blood pressure. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation primarily causes vasodilation and bronchodilation and is not the primary receptor to target in this situation. The D2 receptor is a dopamine receptor, and while dopamine can stimulate this receptor, it is not the primary mechanism of action when used in the acute setting of MI and cardiogenic shock.

Given the need to improve the patient's hemodynamic status by increasing cardiac output and blood pressure, the most appropriate choice would be a medication that stimulates the beta-1 adrenergic receptor. Therefore, the answer is C) Beta-1 adrenergic receptor.",C,True

"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit.

The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area and the subsequent development of a pneumothorax necessitating needle decompression and chest tube placement suggest a significant chest injury. The patient was stabilized with blood and fluid transfusions, and the chest tube was placed, which initially resolved the pneumothorax. However, a repeat chest radiograph shows a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube still in place.

Option A, Esophageal rupture, can be associated with trauma and may lead to pneumothorax due to air leakage into the mediastinum. However, this condition would typically present with additional findings such as mediastinal air or pleural effusion.

Option B, Inappropriate chest tube placement, could result in a pneumothorax if the tube were placed in the wrong location, such as into the lung rather than the pleural space. However, the question stem indicates that the chest tube location was confirmed to be proper on the initial chest radiograph.

Option C, Spontaneous pneumothorax, is unlikely in this context because the patient's injury was due to trauma, not a spontaneous event.

Option D, Tension pneumothorax, is a condition where air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure, displacement of mediastinal structures, and compromised venous return to the heart. This can occur as a result of trauma and can be life-threatening. However, the question stem indicates that the pneumothorax resolved after needle decompression and chest tube placement, which would not be the case with tension pneumothorax.

Option E, Tracheobronchial rupture, is a severe injury that can occur due to blunt trauma, such as in a motor vehicle collision. It can lead to pneumothorax and recurrent pneumothorax despite appropriate management, as air continues to leak from the injured tracheobronchial tree into the pleural space.

She also experiences occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. These symptoms suggest a mood disorder with cyclical changes in mood.

The options given are different types of mood disorders:

A. Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic episodes that last at least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate hospital care. Depressive episodes usually occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks.

B. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I disorder.

C. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents). The symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.

D. Persistent depressive disorder (formerly called dysthymia) is characterized by a chronic form of depression that lasts for at least 2 years in adults (1 year in children and adolescents). The symptoms are not as severe as those of major depression, but they are persistent.

E. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia and a mood disorder (either major depression or a manic episode).

Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms do not meet the full criteria for any of the bipolar disorders (A or B) or schizoaffective disorder (E), as there is no mention of psychotic features or hallucinations that would suggest schizophrenia. Persistent depressive disorder (D) is also less likely because the patient experiences episodes of elevated mood.

The patient's symptoms are more consistent with cyclothymic disorder (C), which involves periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms over a period of years, without meeting the full criteria for a hypomanic episode or a major depressive episode.

She has normal breast and pubic hair development, which suggests that her estrogen levels are likely normal, as indicated by her serum estrogen level of 240 pg/mL, which falls within the normal range. Her follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level is also within the normal range for her age, indicating that her ovaries are responsive and that there is no primary ovarian failure.

The patient's symptoms of headache, photosensitivity, and nausea that are relieved by ibuprofen suggest that she may be experiencing migraine headaches, which is consistent with her family history.

Given that her uterus and ovaries appear normal on ultrasound, structural abnormalities such as an imperforate hymen (C) or vaginal septum (D) are unlikely. There is no evidence of hyperprolactinemia (B), such as galactorrhea or a history suggestive of a prolactinoma, and her symptoms do not suggest hypothalamic amenorrhea (A), which is often associated with stress, weight loss, or excessive exercise.

Considering the normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, normal hormone levels, and the absence of any structural abnormalities, the most likely diagnosis is normal development (E). This patient may simply be a late bloomer, as her older sister also experienced menarche at age 15.

Therefore, the answer is E) Normal development.",E,False

She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed', 'B': 'Patients do not usually initiate treatment', 'C': 'Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia', 'D': 'Patients will typically have a BMI between 17–18.5 kg/m2', 'E': 'Patients usually have significant medical complications'}",A,"The patient's behavior of inducing vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat and the fact that she is looking into diuretics indicate that she is engaging in compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain. This is consistent with a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.

The patient's BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex, which is within the normal range and not consistent with anorexia nervosa, where patients typically have a BMI less than 17–18.5 kg/m2 (option D). Patients with anorexia nervosa are also further sub-typed based on the presence or absence of amenorrhea (option A), and this patient has not been described as initiating treatment (option B). While patients with bulimia nervosa can have a history of both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (option C), this patient's current presentation is more consistent with bulimia nervosa. Lastly, significant medical complications are more commonly seen in patients with anorexia nervosa due to their low body weight and nutritional deficiencies (option E), which is not the case here.

Therefore, the answer is C) Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia.",A,True
"A 42-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He has not been to the doctor since he was 22 years of age. He reports that over the past three months, he has felt tired and weak despite no changes in diet or exercise. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Family history is notable for colorectal cancer in his father and paternal uncle, ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother, and pancreatic cancer in his paternal uncle. Physical examination is notable for conjunctival pallor. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 31%. A stool sample is hemoccult positive and a colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?","{'A': 'Homologous recombination', 'B': 'Base excision repair', 'C': 'Nucleotide excision repair', 'D': 'Mismatch repair', 'E': 'Non-homologous end joining'}",D,"The patient's presentation of fatigue, weakness, and conjunctival pallor, along with a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggests anemia. The positive hemoccult test indicates the presence of blood in the stool, and the colonoscopy findings of a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon suggest colorectal cancer. The family history of various cancers, including colorectal cancer, raises the suspicion of a hereditary cancer syndrome.

The most likely hereditary cancer syndrome associated with colorectal cancer, as well as ovarian and pancreatic cancers, is Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is caused by impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR), which is responsible for correcting errors that occur during DNA replication. The deficiency in MMR leads to microsatellite instability and an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and other cancers.

Therefore, the answer is D) Mismatch repair.",D,True
"A male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation is evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. His mother had no prenatal care. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. He is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","{'A': 'Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound', 'B': 'Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture', 'C': 'Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy', 'D': 'Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning', 'E': 'Patent ductus arteriosus on echocardiography'}",C,"The newborn is born prematurely at 27 weeks' gestation and presents with rapid breathing and hypoxia. The chest x-ray findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities are characteristic of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which is common in preterm infants due to insufficient surfactant production. The most appropriate initial management for RDS is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to maintain lung volumes and improve oxygenation.

Given this clinical scenario, the most likely additional finding would be the presence of hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy. Hyaline membranes are a pathognomonic feature of RDS and are composed of surfactant, cellular debris, and desquamated epithelial cells.

Therefore, the answer is C) Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy.",C,True
"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","{'A': 'Agree to his wish for no further treatment', 'B': 'Begin paroxetine therapy', 'C': 'Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents', 'D': 'Reassure the patient that he will feel better', 'E': 'Start outpatient psychotherapy'}",C,"The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting with loss of appetite, sleeplessness, extreme irritability, social withdrawal, and a constricted affect. He has expressed thoughts of suicide and has access to a firearm. Given the acute nature of his symptoms and the immediate risk of harm to himself, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure his safety. This involves informing his parents and arranging for involuntary hospitalization to initiate treatment and protect the patient from himself. Therefore, the answer is C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents.",C,True
"A 23-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal care visit at 16 weeks gestation. She complains of increased fatigability, but is otherwise well. She takes folic acid, iron, and vitamin D supplementation. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 86/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉).

The reticulocyte count is 0.2%, which is within the normal range, suggesting that the anemia is not due to increased red blood cell destruction. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 90 fL, which is within the normal range (80-100 fL), indicating that the anemia is normocytic. The platelet and leukocyte counts are within normal limits.

Given that the patient is taking iron supplementation and the anemia is normocytic, it would be appropriate to check serum iron levels to confirm whether the patient has iron deficiency anemia, which is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. Serum B12 level would be checked if the anemia was macrocytic (MCV > 100 fL). Transferrin is a measure of iron-binding capacity and may be useful if iron deficiency is suspected. No tests are required if we are not going to investigate the cause of anemia. Total bilirubin would be useful if there was suspicion of hemolysis or liver dysfunction, which is not indicated in this case.

Therefore, the answer is A) Serum iron level.",A,False
A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?,"{'A': 'Left frontal lobe', 'B': 'Left internal capsule', 'C': 'Left temporal lobe', 'D': 'Right frontal lobe', 'E': 'Right temporal lobe'}",A,"The patient's symptoms of sudden onset speech changes with distorted and disconnected words, known as aphasia, along with weakness of the right arm, suggest a neurological event affecting the language centers of the brain. The fact that the patient is right-handed and the speech changes occurred suddenly points towards a stroke affecting the dominant hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in most right-handed individuals. The combination of aphasia and right arm weakness suggests damage to the left frontal lobe, which contains the motor cortex controlling the right arm and the language centers responsible for speech production (Broca's area). Therefore, the correct answer is A) Left frontal lobe.",B,False

The absence of significant findings on the chest X-ray and the presence of sinus tachycardia on the ECG further support this diagnosis. A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is a diagnostic test used to detect PE, and given the clinical suspicion, it would be the most appropriate next step in management. Lower extremity doppler could be used to look for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a source of PE, but the immediate concern is to confirm the PE diagnosis. Subcutaneous fondaparinux is an anticoagulant that could be used to treat PE, but it is important to first confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment. A CT scan could be considered if the V/Q scan is inconclusive, and an inferior vena cava filter is typically reserved for patients who cannot be anticoagulated or have recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation.

The laboratory findings of anemia (hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 45,000/mm3), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 1658 U/L) with schistocytes on the blood smear are indicative of a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The elevated leukocyte count (18,000/mm3) and the recent gastrointestinal symptoms may suggest a preceding infection. The elevated creatinine (1.6 mg/dL) indicates renal impairment.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS is often preceded by a gastrointestinal infection, particularly by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), which is commonly acquired from contaminated food or water, such as might be encountered during a roadtrip in Mexico.

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?","{'A': 'Overflow proteinuria', 'B': 'Transient (functional) proteinuria', 'C': 'Tubular proteinuria', 'D': 'Orthostatic proteinuria', 'E': 'Isolated proteinuria'}",A,"The patient's proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?

Options:
A. Overflow proteinuria
B. Transient (functional) proteinuria
C. Tubular proteinuria
D. Orthostatic proteinuria
E. Isolated proteinuria

To determine the category of proteinuria, we need to consider the clinical context and the laboratory findings. The patient's basic metabolic panel shows an elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL, which indicates renal impairment. The presence of proteinuria without any red blood cells (RBCs) or pus cells in the urinalysis suggests a non-inflammatory cause of kidney damage.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Overflow proteinuria occurs when there is an overproduction of proteins by the kidneys, such as in multiple myeloma with light chains (Bence Jones proteins). However, there is no evidence of such a condition in this patient.

B. Transient (functional) proteinuria is seen in normal individuals after exercise or fever. It is not associated with renal impairment or persistent proteinuria.

C. Tubular proteinuria occurs when there is damage to the renal tubules, leading to the loss of proteins in the urine. Given the patient's elevated creatinine level and the absence of RBCs or pus cells in the urine, this suggests a possible tubular injury.

D. Orthostatic proteinuria is characterized by the presence of protein in the urine when the patient is upright but not when lying down. This condition is typically seen in young, healthy individuals and is not associated with renal dysfunction.

E. Isolated proteinuria refers to the presence of protein in the urine without other abnormal findings. However, in this case, the patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating that the proteinuria is not isolated.

Based on the patient's elevated creatinine level and the absence of RBCs or pus cells in the urine, the most likely category of proteinuria is tubular proteinuria (C). Therefore, the answer is C) Tubular proteinuria.",C,False

"A 70-year-old hypertensive and hyperlipidemic woman comes to the emergency department with chief complaints of acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension with a right-sided weakness for the last 1.5 hours. The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation.

The patient is treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of presentation, which is a standard treatment for ischemic stroke if administered within the appropriate time frame.

The question asks about the cellular process typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient. In the context of ischemic stroke, the reversible injury refers to the area of the brain that has been affected by the lack of blood flow but has not yet suffered irreversible damage. This area is sometimes referred to as the ""penumbra.""

Among the options provided:

A) Mitochondrial permeability changes are associated with cell death and are not characteristic of reversible injury.
B) Caspase activation is a marker of apoptosis, which is a form of programmed cell death and is not indicative of reversible injury.
C) Lysosomal rupture leads to cell damage and death, which is beyond the stage of reversible injury.
D) Severe membrane damage is also associated with irreversible injury and cell death.
E) Decreased ATP is a hallmark of reversible injury. During the early stages of ischemia, cells are able to compensate for the lack of oxygen by using anaerobic metabolism, which still produces ATP albeit at a reduced rate. This decreased ATP production is a characteristic of the reversible phase of injury, as cells have not yet undergone the irreversible damage that would be caused by prolonged ischemia.

Therefore, the answer is E) Decreased ATP.",E,True

However, nadolol is preferred over metoprolol in the prevention of variceal bleeding due to its longer half-life and once-daily dosing, which improves adherence. Therefore, the answer is D) Nadolol.",D,True
"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?","{'A': 'Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased', 'B': 'Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased', 'C': 'Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: no change', 'D': 'Muscle relaxation time: no change, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased', 'E': 'Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased'}",B,"The ATP2A1 gene mutation results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle. This pump is responsible for pumping calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum from the cytosol, which is essential for muscle relaxation. When the pump is not functioning properly, calcium ions accumulate in the cytosol, leading to increased cytosolic calcium concentration. As a result, muscles cannot relax properly, leading to muscle cramping and stiffening.

Based on this information, the expected outcome in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation would be increased muscle relaxation time (due to impaired calcium pumping and subsequent delayed re-uptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and increased cytosolic calcium concentration (due to reduced pumping of calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum).

Therefore, the correct answer is B) Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.",A,False
A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?,"{'A': 'Desmoplastic', 'B': 'Nodular', 'C': 'Acral lentiginous', 'D': 'Lentigo maligna', 'E': 'Superficial spreading'}",C,"The patient is an African-American woman who has no history of serious illness and no abnormal moles or warts on examination. She travels regularly to the Caribbean. The most common type of melanoma in African-Americans is acral lentiginous melanoma, which often occurs on the palms, soles, and under the nails. This type of melanoma is less likely to be associated with sun exposure, which is a risk factor for other types of melanoma. Therefore, the answer is C) Acral lentiginous.",C,True
"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","{'A': 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia', 'B': 'Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis', 'C': 'Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis', 'D': 'Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli', 'E': 'Interstitial cystitis'}",B,"The patient presents with a history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms, and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. The lack of improvement with antimicrobial therapy and the presence of emotional distress and sleep disturbances suggest a non-infectious cause. The physical examination reveals a mildly tender prostate without masses or nodules. The additional symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability may indicate a systemic condition. The urine test results show an elevated white cell count in the expressed prostatic secretion but negative cultures, which is consistent with chronic prostatitis. However, the absence of bacteria in the cultures makes chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (option D) less likely. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (option A) typically presents with lower urinary tract symptoms and is more common in older men. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (option C) would likely present with more acute symptoms and positive cultures. Interstitial cystitis (option E) could explain the urinary symptoms and pelvic pain but would not account for the prostate findings or systemic symptoms. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis (option B) is a diagnosis of exclusion and is characterized by symptoms similar to bacterial prostatitis but without bacterial growth in cultures. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, the lack of bacterial growth despite multiple courses of antibiotics, and the systemic symptoms, chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis is the most likely diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is B) Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.",A,False
"A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of ""feeling like my chest is going to explode."" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Citalopram', 'B': 'Lithium', 'C': 'Lorazepam', 'D': 'Propranolol', 'E': 'Quetiapine'}",A,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with panic attacks, which are a key feature of panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having another attack or the implications of the attack (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack). The patient's avoidance behavior (leaving the house less and less) is also indicative of panic disorder.

The first-line treatment for panic disorder is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (A). SSRIs are preferred due to their efficacy, safety profile, and tolerability. Other options like lithium (B) and quetiapine (E) are not first-line treatments for panic disorder. Lorazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used for acute management of panic attacks but is not ideal for long-term management due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal. Propranolol (D) is a beta-blocker that can help control some physical symptoms of anxiety, such as palpitations and tremors, but it is not sufficient as a sole therapy for panic disorder.

Therefore, the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition is citalopram (A).",A,True
"A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife due to abdominal distension and persistent somnolence for the past 2 weeks. The patient’s wife says that he has been sleeping much more than usual for the past 5 days. His bowel and bladder habit have not changed. His past medical history is significant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. His vital signs include: pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F) and blood pressure 122/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

The patient does not have signs of infection (e.g., fever, leukocytosis), active variceal bleeding (as shown by the endoscopy), or evidence of portal vein thrombosis (which would typically present with abdominal pain and ascites). Hypoglycemia is not indicated by the normal glucose level. The most likely precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in this patient is the elevated ammonia level, which can be precipitated by various factors including infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, and medications. Since the patient has no signs of active bleeding or infection, the most likely precipitating factor in this case is the elevated ammonia level itself, which can be due to metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the answer is B) Metabolic alkalosis.",B,False
"A 34-year-old woman with poorly controlled Crohn disease comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of hair loss and a rash on her face. She has also noticed that food has recently tasted bland to her. She had to undergo segmental small bowel resection several times because of intestinal obstruction and fistula formation. Examination shows several bullous, erythematous perioral plaques. There are two well-circumscribed circular patches of hair loss on the scalp. A deficiency of which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Retinoic acid', 'B': 'Niacin', 'C': 'Cobalamin', 'D': 'Iron', 'E': 'Zinc'}",E,"The patient's symptoms of hair loss, a rash on her face, and bland taste, along with a history of multiple small bowel resections, suggest malabsorption.

Zinc is important for skin and hair health, as well as for the proper taste of food. Retinoic acid deficiency would not typically present with these symptoms. Niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, which is characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency typically presents with megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. Iron deficiency causes anemia, but not the symptoms described in the question.

This imaging pattern is suggestive of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a common complication of cirrhosis. The management of HCC depends on the size and number of lesions, liver function, and the patient's overall condition. Surgical resection is an option for patients with a solitary lesion and good liver function. Since the lesion is 2 cm and there is no mention of multifocal disease or poor liver function, the patient may be a candidate for surgical resection. Therefore, the answer is B) Refer for surgical resection.",B,False
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?","{'A': 'Even with appropriate treatment, your condition will prevent you from becoming pregnant', 'B': 'Improved PKU treatment will decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death', 'C': '3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL', 'D': 'Begin a phenylalanine-restricted diet in your first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal morbidity', 'E': 'Your current phenylalanine levels do not pose a risk to any future pregnancy'}",C,"The correct answer is C) 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL.",C,True

"A 46-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of a cough for 6 months. He has been taking over-the-counter cough medications, but they have not helped much. He adds that he expectorated bloody sputum the previous night. He denies breathlessness but mentions that he frequently experiences fatigue after little physical exertion. There is no past history of any specific medical disorder. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum?","{'A': 'Bence-Jones protein', 'B': 'Calcitonin', 'C': 'CA 15-3', 'D': 'Lactate dehydrogenase', 'E': 'Neuron-specific enolase'}",E,"The patient has been diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the lung.

"A 56-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer presents to the surgical intensive care unit following a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Over the next 3 days, the patient's drainage output is noted to exceed 1 liter per day. In the early morning of postoperative day 4, the nurse states that the patient is difficult to arouse. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/88 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?","{'A': '0.45% saline IV', 'B': '0.9% saline IV', 'C': '5% dextrose IV', 'D': '5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV', 'E': 'Oral free water replacement'}",B,"The patient's serum sodium level is 154 mEq/L, which indicates hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration greater than 145 mEq/L. The patient's high serum sodium level, in conjunction with dry skin and mucous membranes, suggests dehydration. The patient's tachycardia (pulse of 120/min) and altered mental status (difficult to arouse) are concerning for possible sepsis secondary to his recent surgery.

The best next step in management would be to address the hypernatremia and potential dehydration. The administration of free water (oral or IV) would lower the serum sodium concentration and address the dehydration. However, given the patient's altered mental status and potential for sepsis, IV administration of fluids is preferred over oral replacement.

Option A (0.45% saline IV) would provide free water equivalent to 100 mOsm/kg, which would help to lower the serum sodium concentration. Option B (0.9% saline IV) would not be appropriate as it would add more sodium to the patient's system, exacerbating the hypernatremia. Option C (5% dextrose IV) would provide both glucose and water, but the glucose is not necessary in this case, and it would not provide enough free water to adequately address the hypernatremia. Option D (5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV) would provide both glucose and free water, but again, the glucose is not needed, and it would not be the best choice for rapid correction of hypernatremia. Option E (Oral free water replacement) would be inappropriate due to the patient's altered mental status and the need for rapid correction of electrolyte imbalances, which is best achieved via IV administration.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to administer free water IV to correct the hypernatremia and dehydration. Therefore, the answer is A) 0.45% saline IV.",A,False
"A 28-year-old gravida 1 at 32 weeks gestation is evaluated for an abnormal ultrasound that showed fetal microcephaly. Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?","{'A': 'Dengue virus', 'B': 'Bartonella henselae', 'C': 'Rubella virus', 'D': 'Toxoplasmosis', 'E': 'Zika virus'}",E,"The patient's symptoms of fevers, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, along with the travel history to Brazil, are suggestive of a mosquito-borne illness. The negative IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis rule out option D. The absence of a history of alcohol or cigarette use, as well as all recommended childhood vaccinations, makes congenital infections less likely, which rules out option C (Rubella virus). Bartonella henselae is associated with cat scratch disease, which typically presents with a localized papule and regional lymphadenopathy, not the systemic symptoms described in the patient, thus ruling out option B. Dengue virus is endemic in Brazil, but it typically presents with high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, and rash, which is different from the patient's presentation, so option A is less likely. Zika virus, which is also endemic in Brazil, is known to cause microcephaly in infants when the infection is contracted during pregnancy. The patient's symptoms and the abnormal ultrasound findings in the fetus are consistent with Zika virus infection. Therefore, the most likely etiologic agent is Zika virus.",A,False
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL

Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?","{'A': 'Ofloxacin', 'B': 'Cefepime', 'C': 'Cefotaxime', 'D': 'Amoxicillin', 'E': 'Cephalexin'}",D,"The patient presents with symptoms of intermittent vertigo, vomiting, complete hearing loss in the left ear, and a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. These findings are suggestive of acute otitis media with complications, possibly a labyrinthine infection given the vertigo and hearing loss. The presence of nystagmus further supports this diagnosis. The MRI of the brain rules out central causes such as a tumor or abscess. The patient's blood work shows an elevated white blood cell count with a predominance of neutrophils, indicating a bacterial infection.

Given the severity of the symptoms and the potential for a labyrinthine infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics are warranted. Ofloxacin (A) is a fluoroquinolone and has good coverage for otitis media, but it is not the first-line treatment for suspected labyrinthine infections. Cefepime (B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity, including against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can be a pathogen in labyrinthine infections. Cefotaxime (C) is also a third-generation cephalosporin with good coverage for otitis media but may not be as effective against Pseudomonas. Amoxicillin (D) is typically used for uncomplicated otitis media but may not be sufficient for a labyrinthine infection. Cephalexin (E) is a first-generation cephalosporin and is not the best choice for this scenario.

Considering the need for broad-spectrum coverage, especially against Pseudomonas, the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient would be Cefepime (B). Therefore, the answer is B) Cefepime.",B,False
"A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue. During this time, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. She reports trouble concentrating at her job as a preschool teacher and has missed work several times in recent weeks due to generalized fatigue. She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit smoking. A drug is prescribed that will treat the patient's mood disturbance and support smoking cessation. This patient should be counseled about which of the following possible side effects of this drug?","{'A': 'Decreased libido', 'B': 'Hypotension', 'C': 'Urinary retention', 'D': 'Tachycardia', 'E': 'QTc prolongation'}",D,"The patient is being treated for a depressed mood and fatigue, and the drug prescribed is intended to address these symptoms while also supporting smoking cessation. One such medication that fits this description is bupropion (Wellbutrin), an atypical antidepressant that is also used as an aid for smoking cessation.

Among the side effects listed, decreased libido is a known side effect of many antidepressants, including bupropion. Hypotension is not a typical side effect of bupropion; in fact, it can sometimes cause hypertension. Urinary retention is more commonly associated with medications that have anticholinergic effects, which bupropion does not have. Tachycardia is not a typical side effect of bupropion; it can sometimes cause a slight increase in heart rate, but not tachycardia. QTc prolongation is associated with certain medications, but it is not a side effect of bupropion.

Therefore, the answer is A) Decreased libido.",A,False
"A 46-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with one week of intermittent nausea and vomiting. She does not have any sick contacts, and her medical history is significant only for diabetes well-controlled on metformin. She also complains of some weakness and back/leg pain. She says that she recently returned from traveling abroad and had been administered an antibiotic during her travels for an unknown infection. On presentation, her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 119/78 mmHg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 25/min. An EKG is obtained showing flattening of the T wave.

The prescription of a thiazide diuretic indicates that the physician suspects hypercalcemia, as thiazides are used to treat this condition. Hypercalcemia can be associated with multiple diseases, but given the options provided, the most likely associated condition is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE can cause hypercalcemia due to increased bone resorption and renal tubular dysfunction. Therefore, the answer is D) Systemic lupus erythematosus.",D,False
"A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of drowsiness at work for the past several months. He finds his work as a computer programmer rewarding and looks forward to coming into the office every day. However, he often falls asleep during meetings even though he usually gets a good night sleep and has limited his exposure to alcohol and caffeine in the evening. His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Methylphenidate', 'B': 'Sodium oxybate', 'C': 'Imipramine', 'D': 'Increase daytime naps', 'E': 'Changing career'}",A,"The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness despite getting sufficient sleep at night and having no significant past medical history. The mean sleep latency of 6 minutes on the sleep study suggests that he falls asleep quickly during the day, which is indicative of a sleep disorder. The fact that he does not snore or stop breathing during sleep rules out obstructive sleep apnea. The patient’s condition is likely due to a primary hypersomnia or idiopathic hypersomnia, given the normal sleep study results and the absence of other contributing factors.

The best course of treatment for primary or idiopathic hypersomnia includes lifestyle modifications such as increasing daytime naps. This can help manage the symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness without the need for pharmacological interventions, which may have side effects or potential for abuse.

Therefore, the answer is D) Increase daytime naps.",D,False
"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision where he was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is unconscious. His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Cardiac contusion', 'B': 'Hemothorax', 'C': 'Aortic dissection', 'D': 'Pulmonary contusion', 'E': 'Cardiac tamponade\n""'}",A,"The patient's presentation with unconsciousness, respiratory distress, hypotension, tachycardia, multiple ecchymoses over the chest, increased jugular venous pressure, and crackles at the lung bases suggests significant trauma with possible internal injuries. The absence of murmurs, rubs, or gallops on cardiac examination and the presence of a laceration over the scalp may indicate trauma to the head and neck region. The irregularly irregular pulse and the absence of p-waves on the electrocardiogram suggest atrial activity, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation or flutter. The rapid deterioration despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors indicates a severe and rapidly progressing condition.

The FAST examination being negative rules out free fluid in the pericardium, abdomen, or pelvis, making cardiac tamponade (E) less likely. Pulmonary contusion (D) could explain the crackles at the lung bases and respiratory distress but would not typically result in hypotension and tachycardia to this extent, nor would it explain the increased jugular venous pressure and absent p-waves.

Aortic dissection (C) could present with hypotension and tachycardia but is less likely to cause the increased jugular venous pressure and would not typically result in absent p-waves.

Hemothorax (B) could explain the hypotension, tachycardia, and increased jugular venous pressure due to blood in the pleural space compromising venous return. However, the FAST examination being negative makes this diagnosis less likely.

Cardiac contusion (A) is a possibility given the chest ecchymoses and the mechanism of injury. It can cause arrhythmias, hypotension, and tachycardia due to direct trauma to the heart. The absence of p-waves on the electrocardiogram suggests atrial involvement, which is consistent with a cardiac contusion affecting the conduction system.

Considering the mechanism of injury, physical findings, and rapid deterioration despite resuscitative efforts, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac contusion. Therefore, the answer is A) Cardiac contusion.",A,True
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child’s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents’ death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway', 'B': 'Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway', 'C': 'Adenosine deaminase of the purine metabolism pathway', 'D': 'Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway', 'E': 'Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway'}",D,"The patient's presentation, including self-mutilating behavior, facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements, along with the absence of teeth since a young age, is highly suggestive of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), which is involved in the purine salvage pathway. This condition leads to the accumulation of uric acid, resulting in self-mutilation, neurological dysfunction, and renal problems. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) of the purine metabolism pathway. The answer is D) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway.",D,True
"A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been ""large"" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?","{'A': 'Hypothyroidism', 'B': 'Idiopathic hirsutism', 'C': ""Cushing's disease"", 'D': 'Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)', 'E': 'Ovarian hyperthecosis'}",D,"The patient's presentation includes concerns about physical appearance, specifically her weight and acne, as well as unwanted facial hair. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and an abnormal glucose tolerance test result, indicating possible insulin resistance. Additionally, she has infrequent menstrual cycles (every 45 days), which can be a sign of anovulation. Her physical examination reveals severe inflammatory acne and hirsutism. These findings, along with her obesity (weight of 85 kg at a height of 160 cm), suggest a hormonal disorder.

Option A, Hypothyroidism, typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. While weight gain is present in this patient, the other symptoms are not mentioned, and hypothyroidism does not typically cause acne or hirsutism.

Option B, Idiopathic hirsutism, is characterized by the presence of excess hair growth in women without other signs of virilization or hormonal abnormalities. This patient's acne and obesity suggest a hormonal cause beyond idiopathic hirsutism.

Option C, Cushing's disease, is associated with symptoms such as central obesity, facial rounding, purple striae, and hypertension. Although this patient has central obesity and hypertension, the absence of other characteristic features makes Cushing's disease less likely.

Option D, Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by symptoms such as obesity, acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, and insulin resistance, which align with the patient's presentation.

Option E, Ovarian hyperthecosis, is a condition that can cause hirsutism and virilization, but it is less common than PCOS and typically occurs in postmenopausal women.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is PCOS, which is characterized by obesity, acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, and insulin resistance. Therefore, the answer is D) Polycystic o",A,False
"A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for urinary incontinence. She has been waking up every morning with her underwear soaked in urine. She notices that at work if she does not take regular bathroom breaks her underwear will have some urine in it. She urinates 5 to 11 times per day but she claims it is a small volume. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?","{'A': 'Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization', 'B': 'Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night', 'C': 'No recommendations needed', 'D': 'Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks', 'E': 'Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics'}",A,"The patient is presenting with symptoms of urinary incontinence, specifically nocturnal enuresis and urge incontinence given the need for regular bathroom breaks. Her medical history includes hypertension, as evidenced by her blood pressure of 167/108 mmHg, and diabetes, as indicated by her use of metformin and insulin. The decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities may suggest a peripheral neuropathy, which is common in diabetes. The systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border could indicate a cardiac issue, such as aortic stenosis, which can be associated with hypertension.

Considering her medications, it is important to note that lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension, atorvastatin is a statin used for cholesterol management, and sodium docusate is a stool softener. None of these medications are directly related to urinary incontinence.

Treatment options for urinary incontinence include lifestyle modifications, behavioral therapies, and medications. Bethanechol is a cholinergic agonist that can be used to treat urinary retention, not incontinence, so options A and B are not appropriate. No recommendations needed (option C) is not suitable as the patient is symptomatic and seeking treatment. Reducing fluid intake and discontinuing diuretics (option E) may be helpful in some cases of urinary incontinence, but given the patient's hypertension and the fact that she is already on lisinopril, it may not be the best initial step.

Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic medication that can help with symptoms of an overactive bladder, such as urge incontinence. Scheduled bathroom breaks can also be a helpful behavioral strategy to manage urinary incontinence. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient, considering her symptoms and medical history, would be to start with oxybutynin to address the urge incontinence and recommend scheduled bathroom breaks to manage her frequency.

Therefore, the answer is D) Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks.",C,False

The peripheral blood smear findings of red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis are indicative of a macrocytic anemia. Given the patient's dietary history of mostly potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago, it is likely that he is not getting adequate vitamin B12, which is commonly found in meat and dairy products. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms, such as the mild postural tremor seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is vitamin B12 deficiency. The answer is D) Vitamin B12 deficiency.",D,False
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin.

Porphyrias are a group of disorders caused by deficiencies in enzymes involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. The most likely type in this case is Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT), which is the most common form of porphyria. PCT is characterized by photosensitivity leading to blistering on sun-exposed areas, hyperpigmentation, and increased hair growth. It can also cause liver dysfunction, leading to splenomegaly and neurological symptoms.

The patient's father's history of gallstones may be related to the liver dysfunction associated with PCT. The treatment for PCT includes phlebotomy to reduce iron overload, which can contribute to the disease, as well as avoiding triggers such as alcohol, estrogen, and certain medications.

None of the options provided (A, B, C, D, or E) are standard treatments for PCT or would have prevented the oropharyngeal symptoms. However, if we consider the most appropriate option from the given choices, a gluten-free diet (C) is used to treat celiac disease, which can cause similar symptoms such as mouth ulcers and anemia but does not typically cause the skin findings seen in this patient.

Therefore, the answer is C) Gluten-free diet.",C,False

"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is “taking over” her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg.

This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them. The symptoms have been present for a long time, as indicated by the onset in high school, and are causing significant impairment in her daily functioning.

The most appropriate next step in management for hoarding disorder is psychotherapy, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The patient has already been attending CBT sessions for the past 6 months, but has not shown improvement. Therefore, the next step would be to consider pharmacotherapy.

Among the options provided, fluoxetine (B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which often co-occurs with hoarding disorder. Although hoarding disorder is not specifically listed as an indication for fluoxetine, SSRIs like fluoxetine are often used as a first-line treatment for hoarding disorder due to their efficacy in treating OCD symptoms.

Atomoxetine (A) is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is not indicated for hoarding disorder. Lamotrigine (C) is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder, and buspirone (D) is an anxiolytic that is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hoarding disorder. Methylphenidate (E) is another medication used for ADHD and is not indicated for hoarding disorder.

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

A 27-year-old man and his wife come to the physician for preconception genetic counseling. The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown.

"A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion and a cough productive of a small amount of grayish-white phlegm. The cough had been initially nonproductive. He has not had fever or chest pain. He is originally from China and visits his family there once every year. He has worked as a car salesman for 15 years and worked in a shipyard before that for 22 years. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 13 years but stopped 25 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Fine expiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening in both lungs. A photomicrograph from a sputum sample is shown. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","{'A': 'Increased alveolar-arterial gradient', 'B': 'Bloody pleural effusion', 'C': 'Increased total lung capacity', 'D': 'Concave flow-volume loop', 'E': 'Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO)'}",A,"The patient's history of working in a shipyard, the presence of fine expiratory crackles, and patchy infiltrates with supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening on the chest x-ray are suggestive of asbestosis, a type of pneumoconiosis caused by asbestos exposure. Asbestosis is characterized by interstitial fibrosis and pleural plaques. The sputum photomicrograph would likely show asbestos bodies.

Increased alveolar-arterial gradient (A) is seen in conditions that cause impaired gas exchange, such as interstitial lung diseases and emphysema. However, it is not specific to asbestosis.

Bloody pleural effusion (B) is not typically associated with asbestosis. It could be seen in conditions like malignancy, infection, or trauma.

Increased total lung capacity (C) is seen in conditions like emphysema where there is hyperinflation of the lungs. Asbestosis typically causes a restrictive pattern, not an obstructive one, so it would not lead to increased total lung capacity.

Concave flow-volume loop (D) is seen in obstructive lung diseases like asthma and COPD due to decreased airflow. Asbestosis causes a restrictive pattern, so the flow-volume loop would not be concave.

Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO) (E) is not expected in asbestosis. In fact, DLCO is usually decreased in interstitial lung diseases because of impaired gas exchange.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient with asbestosis would be an increased alveolar-arterial gradient due to impaired gas exchange. The answer is A) Increased alveolar-arterial gradient.",A,True

Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Respiratory alkalosis', 'B': 'Metabolic acidosis', 'C': 'Metabolic alkalosis', 'D': 'Respiratory acidosis', 'E': 'Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis'}",C,"The patient is a 1-month-old girl presenting with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability. The vomiting is projectile and occurs after every feeding, but the child still seeks milk after each episode. The physical examination reveals a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region, and the patient appears mildly dehydrated and listless. These findings are highly suggestive of pyloric stenosis, which is a condition characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter leading to gastric outlet obstruction.

Pyloric stenosis typically presents with projectile vomiting that occurs shortly after feeding. The vomiting is due to the inability of the hypertrophied pylorus to relax and allow food to pass from the stomach to the duodenum. As a result, the stomach contents are repeatedly expelled, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The most common acid-base disturbance associated with pyloric stenosis is hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. This occurs because the loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid) from repeated vomiting leads to a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration (alkalosis), and the body compensates by increasing renal bicarbonate reabsorption, which further exacerbates the alkalosis. Additionally, the loss of chloride ions in the vomit leads to hypochloremia.

Therefore, the answer is C) Metabolic alkalosis.",C,True

Among the options given, the pinna (B) and the larynx (E) are the structures that contain cartilage. However, type II collagen is the main collagen found in cartilage, and chondroitin sulfate is a major component of the proteoglycans in cartilage. Since the lens (D) is avascular and does not contain type II collagen or chondroitin sulfate, it can be ruled out. The blood vessel (A) primarily contains type I collagen, and the pubic symphysis (C) is a cartilaginous structure but does not contain type II collagen or chondroitin sulfate. Therefore, the most likely origin of the surgical specimen is the cartilaginous part of the ear, which is the pinna. Hence, the answer is B) Pinna.",B,False
"A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Fasting glucose 97 mg/L
ALT 12 IU/L
AST 14 IU/L
Total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 µmol/L)
Plasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 µmol/L)
Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?","{'A': 'HbA1c measurement', 'B': 'No tests required', 'C': 'Urinalysis', 'D': 'Oral glucose tolerance test', 'E': 'Random plasma glucose'}",B,"The patient is a 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation who reports a 1+ glucose result on a dipstick test. She has no significant co-morbidities, and her pregnancy course has been unremarkable. Her BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2, and she has gained 3 kg during the pregnancy. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and her laboratory tests show normal fasting glucose, liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and plasma creatinine levels.

Given the patient's normal fasting glucose level and lack of symptoms, it is unlikely that she has gestational diabetes at this point. The dipstick test may have been a false positive, which can occur due to various factors such as contaminated urine or the presence of other substances that interfere with the test.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a urinalysis (Option C) to rule out other causes of proteinuria or glucosuria, such as a urinary tract infection or kidney disease. This will help determine if there is an actual glucose presence in the urine and assess for any other abnormalities.

HbA1c measurement (Option A) is not indicated in this scenario as it is used to diagnose and monitor long-term glucose control in diabetes, and the patient's fasting glucose is normal.

No tests are required (Option B) at this point since the fasting glucose is normal, and there are no symptoms or significant findings to suggest gestational diabetes.

An oral glucose tolerance test (Option D) is used to diagnose gestational diabetes, typically performed between 24-28 weeks gestation, and is not indicated at this stage.

Random plasma glucose (Option E) is not useful in this context as it does not provide information about glucose handling by the kidneys, which is what the dipstick test is assessing.

Therefore, the answer is C) Urinalysis.",A,False
"A 58-year-old male with a history of obesity and hypertension presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He currently takes hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 135/80 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 17/min. His BMI is 31 kg/m2. Results of a lipid panel are: Total cholesterol is 280 mg/dl, triglycerides are 110 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol is 40 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol is 195 mg/dl. Her physician considers starting her on atorvastatin. Which of the following will most likely decrease after initiating this medication?","{'A': 'Mevalonate', 'B': 'Acetoacetyl-CoA', 'C': 'HMG-CoA', 'D': 'Diacyglycerol', 'E': 'High-density lipoprotein'}",A,"The patient has a history of obesity and hypertension and is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide. His lipid panel results show a total cholesterol of 280 mg/dl, triglycerides are 110 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol is 40 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol is 195 mg/dl. His physician is considering starting him on atorvastatin. Atorvastatin is a statin medication that works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol. This inhibition leads to decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased uptake of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. As a result, the levels of LDL cholesterol are expected to decrease. However, the medication does not directly affect HDL cholesterol, mevalonate, acetoacetyl-CoA, or diacylglycerol in the manner that it affects LDL cholesterol. Therefore, the answer is C) HMG-CoA.",C,False
A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?,"{'A': 'Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol', 'B': 'Decreased PTH, increased calcium, increased phosphate, increased calcitriol', 'C': 'Increased PTH, increased calcium, decreased phosphate, decreased calcitriol', 'D': 'Decreased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol', 'E': 'Normal PTH, normal calcium, normal phosphate, normal calcitriol'}",A,"The patient has a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy and presents with bone pain. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism due to phosphate retention and decreased production of calcitriol (active form of vitamin D). This results in decreased calcium absorption from the gut and secondary hyperparathyroidism to compensate for hypocalcemia. The increased PTH then leads to increased bone turnover, which can manifest as bone pain.

Therefore, the most expected laboratory findings in this patient would be:

Increased PTH (due to secondary hyperparathyroidism)
Decreased calcium (due to decreased absorption from the gut and increased use by the parathyroid glands)
Increased phosphate (due to decreased excretion by the kidneys)
Decreased calcitriol (due to decreased production by the kidneys)

The correct answer is A) Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.",A,True
"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg.

This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?","{'A': 'Ovarian epithelial cells', 'B': 'Germ cells', 'C': 'Chorionic epithelial cells', 'D': 'Endometrial cells', 'E': 'Stromal cells'}",B,"The patient is presenting with symptoms of dragging pelvic pain, weight loss, irregular menses, fever, tachycardia, and hyperreflexia. The negative urine pregnancy test rules out pregnancy-related causes of an adnexal mass. The presence of a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass on ultrasonography suggests an ovarian neoplasm.

Ovarian neoplasms can be derived from various cell types, including ovarian epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells. Chorionic epithelial cells and endometrial cells are not typically associated with ovarian neoplasms.

Given the patient's age and the characteristics of the mass, the most likely cell type from which the adnexal mass is derived is ovarian epithelial cells (Option A). Ovarian epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian neoplasms and can present with the symptoms described in the patient.

Therefore, the answer is A) Ovarian epithelial cells.",A,False

"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?","{'A': 'Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation', 'B': 'Refer this case to the court', 'C': 'Contact another family member for consent', 'D': 'Perform the surgery without consent', 'E': 'Report the daughter to the police'}",C,"The patient is in a comatose state and unable to provide consent for medical procedures. The daughter, who is the legal surrogate decision-maker, refuses to consent to a life-saving operation. The physician has learned that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter states she wants “to live in peace.” The absence of a written advanced directive leaves the physician in a challenging ethical and legal situation.

In such cases, the physician must consider the best interest of the patient. Since the patient is in a comatose state and the daughter’s refusal to consent could result in the patient’s death, the physician may consider option B (refer this case to the court) as the most appropriate course of action. The court can provide guidance on whether the operation should be performed, taking into account the patient’s best interest and the daughter’s wishes in the context of the patient’s past behavior.

The treatment for anaphylaxis includes administration of epinephrine, which acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. One of the effects of epinephrine on the heart is an increase in heart rate, which is mediated by its action on beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the sinoatrial node, leading to increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4 of the cardiac pacemaker cells' action potential. This results in a faster depolarization and thus an increased heart rate. Therefore, the answer is A) Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4.",A,True

Among the options provided:
A. Diazepam is not a standard treatment for smoking cessation.
B. Nicotine patch could be considered, but the patient previously experienced severe headaches and insomnia with nicotine lozenges, which are similar in concept to nicotine patches.
C. Varenicline is a smoking cessation aid that works by blocking the nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing the pleasure derived from smoking and the withdrawal symptoms. It does not contain nicotine and therefore would not cause the side effects that the patient has experienced with nicotine-containing products.
D. Motivational interviewing is a counseling technique that can be helpful for smoking cessation, but the patient has already tried several times without success, and it may not be the most appropriate next step given her previous unsuccessful attempts and side effects experienced with pharmacotherapy.

Assuming this patient has no other cardiovascular defects, what is the most appropriate treatment?","{'A': 'Indomethacin', 'B': 'Thiazide diuretic', 'C': 'Aspirin', 'D': 'Penicillin', 'E': 'Reassurance'}",A,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is a common finding in preterm infants. The continuous ""machine-like"" murmur, along with the bounding peripheral pulses, are classic findings for PDA. The PDA is a fetal structure that normally closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, it often remains open (patent) due to the immaturity of the lungs and other organ systems.

The treatment for a hemodynamically significant PDA in a preterm infant typically involves the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as indomethacin or ibuprofen. These medications help to encourage the closure of the ductus by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are involved in keeping the ductus arteriosus open.

Thiazide diuretics are not used in the treatment of PDA. Aspirin is not effective in this context and is not recommended for infants. Penicillin is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate for treating a PDA. Reassurance alone is not an appropriate treatment for a hemodynamically significant PDA, as the condition can lead to complications if left untreated.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient, assuming no other cardiovascular defects are present, is indomethacin.

A photograph of the peripheral blood smear is shown. Blood and urine cultures are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""","{'A': 'HELLP syndrome', 'B': 'Dengue hemorrhagic fever', 'C': 'Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura', 'D': 'Hemolytic uremic syndrome', 'E': 'Autoimmune hemolytic anemia\n""'}",C,"The patient presents with fever, headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, bleeding gums, pallor, scleral icterus, and petechiae. The laboratory findings indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The peripheral blood smear is likely to show schistocytes. The patient's recent travel history to Sri Lanka raises suspicion for an infectious etiology. The absence of bacteria in the urine and negative blood cultures help rule out bacterial infections. The negative Coomb's test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The absence of neurologic abnormalities and normal fibrin split products make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) less likely. HELLP syndrome is associated with pregnancy and typically presents with hypertension and proteinuria, which are not mentioned in the case. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a viral illness common in Sri Lanka and can present with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic manifestations, and elevated LDH levels. Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is Dengue hemorrhagic fever. Therefore, the answer is B) Dengue hemorrhagic fever.",B,False
"A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital’s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?","{'A': 'Alanine aminotransferase', 'B': 'Alkaline phosphatase', 'C': 'Creatine kinase (CK-MB)', 'D': 'Lactate dehydrogenase', 'E': 'Troponin T'}",C,"The patient is presenting with chest pain 5 days after an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is currently experiencing discomfort in his chest and left shoulder. This suggests a possible recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction. The most useful laboratory test to evaluate for myocardial injury is cardiac biomarkers. Of the options provided, Troponin T is the most sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury and is elevated in the setting of myocardial infarction. Therefore, the answer is E) Troponin T.",E,False
"A 65-year-old man presents with pain in his left thigh for a week. He describes the pain as dull and constant, boring in nature, and localized deep below the thigh muscle. He says it is worse at night. Physical examination is significant for tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh. A plain radiograph of the left femur shows increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space. Laboratory studies show:
Alkaline phosphatase
925 U/L
Serum calcium
9.2 mg/dL
Serum phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL
Findings on bone biopsy are shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","{'A': 'Osteomalacia', 'B': ""Ewing's sarcoma"", 'C': 'Osteitis deformans', 'D': 'Osteochondritis dissecans', 'E': 'Osteitis fibrosa cystica'}",C,"The patient's symptoms of dull, constant, and boring pain localized deep below the thigh muscle, which worsens at night, along with tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh, suggest a pathology involving the bone. The radiographic finding of increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space is indicative of a bone disorder.

The laboratory studies show an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 925 U/L, which is suggestive of increased bone turnover. The serum calcium level is within the normal range, and the serum phosphorus level is slightly elevated.

Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is Paget's disease of bone, also known as osteitis deformans. This condition is characterized by excessive bone turnover, leading to bone enlargement and deformities. The increased cortical thickness and widened intercortical space seen on the radiograph are consistent with Paget's disease.

Therefore, the answer is C) Osteitis deformans.",C,True
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police. He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. As part of the patient’s initial workup, a head CT is performed which is unremarkable, and an arterial blood gas is performed as seen below:

pH: 7.29
PaCO2: 95 mm Hg
PaO2: 70 mm Hg
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L

The PaCO2 is 95 mm Hg, which is above the normal range of 35-45 mm Hg, suggesting respiratory acidosis. The bicarbonate level is 24 mEq/L, which is on the higher side of the normal range (22-28 mEq/L), indicating a metabolic compensation for the respiratory acidosis.

Given the patient's history of polysubstance abuse, we need to consider substances that can cause respiratory depression leading to carbon dioxide retention. Among the options provided:

A) Alcohol can cause respiratory depression, but it is more likely to cause an immediate coma rather than a compensated respiratory acidosis.
B) Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, can cause respiratory depression, but it is also more likely to cause seizures and cardiac arrhythmias.
C) Cocaine typically causes sympathomimetic effects and would not be expected to cause respiratory depression.
D) Ethylene glycol poisoning primarily causes metabolic acidosis, not respiratory acidosis.
E) Heroin, an opioid, is well-known to cause respiratory depression and would lead to the retention of carbon dioxide, resulting in respiratory acidosis.

Considering the patient's presentation and the blood gas findings, the most likely etiology is respiratory depression due to opioid use. Therefore, the answer is E) Heroin.",E,True
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain and swelling of her right knee joint and left wrist. She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Autoantibody production', 'B': 'Intravenous drug use', 'C': 'Sexually transmitted infection', 'D': 'HLA-B 27 positivity', 'E': 'Bacterial pharyngitis\n""'}",C,"The patient's presentation of a pustule on the sole of the foot, joint pain, and swelling, along with the presence of intracellular organisms in the joint fluid, is suggestive of a gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection can lead to disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), which often presents with tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and migratory polyarthralgia. The strongest risk factor for gonococcal infection is sexual activity, particularly with a new partner, as in the case of this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Sexually transmitted infection.",D,False
"A 64-year-old man presents with severe respiratory distress. This has onset over the past 3 weeks, progressively worsening. Past history involves congestive heart failure (CHF). Due to concerns of concurrent pneumonia, sputum studies are ordered. Microscopic examination of his sputum demonstrates heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages). Which of the following cellular organelles is significant in the formation of these cells?","{'A': 'Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)', 'B': 'Ribosomes', 'C': 'Lysosomes', 'D': 'Golgi apparatus', 'E': 'Mitochondria'}",C,"The presence of hemosiderin-containing macrophages in the sputum of a patient with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) suggests that these cells are related to the pathology of CHF. In CHF, there is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation leading to transudation of red blood cells into the alveoli. Macrophages then phagocytize these red blood cells, resulting in the release of hemosiderin, which is a breakdown product of hemoglobin. The cellular organelle significant in the formation of these cells is the lysosome, which contains enzymes that break down cellular debris, including hemoglobin. Therefore, the answer is C) Lysosomes.",C,True
"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL
Hematocrit 29.1%
Red cell count 3.7 million/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 71 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 21.3 pg/cell

Which of the following findings would most likely be found on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient?","{'A': 'Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration', 'B': '↑ megakaryocytes', 'C': '↓ hemosiderin stores', 'D': 'Ringed sideroblasts', 'E': 'Myeloblasts with immature precursors'}",C,"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion, which are suggestive of anemia. The laboratory findings support this with a low hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL and hematocrit of 29.1%. The red cell indices show a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 71 μm3, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) of 21.3 pg/cell, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of 28.4 Hb/cell, indicating microcytic hypochromic anemia. The reticulocyte count is low at 0.2%, suggesting that the anemia is not due to acute blood loss or hemolysis, but rather a production problem in the bone marrow. The high red cell distribution width (RDW) indicates a significant anisocytosis, which is consistent with a mixed population of red blood cells. The iron studies show a high total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and low transferrin saturation, which are typical findings in iron deficiency anemia.

Given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and noncompliance with medications, as well as a significant smoking history, chronic blood loss is a likely cause of iron deficiency anemia. In the setting of iron deficiency anemia, one would expect to find hypocellularity with fatty infiltration of the bone marrow due to the lack of raw materials (iron) to produce hemoglobin and red blood cells. Therefore, the most likely finding on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient would be A) Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration.",C,True
"A 35-year-old woman is brought into the clinic by a concerned neighbor who says that the patient is often seen setting up bear traps all around her property because of an impending ‘invasion of the mole people.’ The patient has come to the clinic wearing a garlic necklace. She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone.

The absence of auditory hallucinations or visual hallucinations does not rule out a psychotic disorder, as patients can have delusions without these symptoms. Given that she has no past psychiatric history and her symptoms seem to be acute, a brief trial of antipsychotic therapy would be appropriate to address her delusional beliefs and any other psychotic symptoms she may be experiencing. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is not the best initial treatment for acute psychosis, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is typically reserved for severe, treatment-resistant cases or when a rapid response is needed in the context of a medical emergency. Referring to outpatient group therapy may be helpful in the long-term management of her condition, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. Therefore, the answer is D) A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy.",D,False

Carcinoid syndrome typically occurs in the setting of a carcinoid tumor, which is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that often arises in the gastrointestinal tract. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration supports this diagnosis, as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is a metabolite of serotonin, which is produced by carcinoid tumors.

The most common site for a carcinoid tumor is the ileum, which is part of the small intestine. These tumors can lead to the secretion of various substances, including serotonin, which can cause the characteristic symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.

Option A (Proximal muscle wasting) is more suggestive of a condition like celiac disease or malabsorption syndrome.
Option B (Achlorhydria) refers to an absence of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions and is not directly related to carcinoid syndrome.
Option C (Adrenal medullary mass) would suggest a pheochromocytoma, which is a different type of tumor that can cause hypertension but does not typically present with the symptoms described in the patient.
Option D (Multiple peptic ulcers) could be seen in conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors leading to excessive acid production and peptic ulcer disease, but this does not fit with the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.
Option E (Pulmonic valve stenosis) is not related to the symptoms and findings described in this patient.

"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 ","{'A': 'Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound', 'B': 'Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months', 'C': 'Elective endovascular repair', 'D': 'Elective open surgical repair', 'E': 'Emergency open surgical repair'}",E,"The patient presents with a small, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and has a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, transient ischemic attacks, smoking, and heavy alcohol use. The presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and 'bruising on his feet' (likely livedo reticularis due to peripheral embolization) are concerning for impending rupture. The patient's vital signs show hypertension, and the physical examination reveals a carotid bruit, which may indicate aortic stenosis or atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of embolic events. Given the size of the AAA (4.1 cm), it is at high risk for rupture, and the patient's symptoms suggest that rupture may be imminent.

The management of AAA depends on the size of the aneurysm and the presence of symptoms. For asymptomatic AAAs less than 5.5 cm in diameter, surveillance is recommended. However, for symptomatic AAAs or those greater than 5.5 cm, surgical intervention is indicated.

Given the patient's symptoms and the size of the aneurysm, immediate surgical repair is necessary to prevent rupture and potential death. The options for surgical repair are either open surgical repair (OSR) or endovascular repair (EVAR). EVAR is less invasive and has a shorter recovery time compared to OSR. However, the decision between EVAR and OSR depends on various factors, including the size and shape of the aneurysm, patient comorbidities, and surgeon expertise.

Since the question does not provide specific contraindications to EVAR and given the patient's high risk for complications from a major surgery due to his cardiovascular disease, it would be reasonable to opt for the less invasive EVAR if the patient's anatomy is suitable.

Therefore, the answer is C) Elective endovascular repair.",C,False

The fact that he was found undressing himself outside in extreme heat and subsequently developed these symptoms makes heat stroke a likely diagnosis. Heat stroke is characterized by a core body temperature greater than 40°C (104°F) and central nervous system abnormalities such as confusion or coma. The patient's refusal to cooperate and assaultive behavior prior to becoming somnolent and non-responsive could be attributed to the effects of the hyperthermia on his mental status. Additionally, the dry mucous membranes indicate dehydration, which is consistent with heat stroke. Catatonic schizophrenia, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and oversedation do not typically present with such high fever and are less likely to occur in this clinical context.

The presence of blood in the urine (hematuria) without red blood cells (RBCs) suggests rhabdomyolysis, which is the breakdown of muscle tissue leading to the release of muscle fiber contents into the bloodstream. One of the muscle fiber contents released during rhabdomyolysis is myoglobin, which can cause the urine to appear tea-colored.

Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), which is consistent with the patient's presentation. In AKI, the kidneys are unable to filter waste products properly, leading to an accumulation of substances like creatinine and urea in the blood. Therefore, we would expect the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to be elevated.

The other options are less likely given the clinical scenario:
A. Low serum potassium is not typically associated with rhabdomyolysis.
B. Low serum lactate dehydrogenase is not consistent with muscle breakdown.
D. Elevated serum calcium is not directly related to rhabdomyolysis or acute kidney injury.
E. Elevated serum creatine kinase is a marker of muscle damage, but it is not a serum finding; rather, it is found in the bloodstream due to muscle breakdown.

Physical exam is not remarkable and an initial head CT is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': '100% oxygen', 'B': 'Ibuprofen', 'C': 'Lumbar puncture', 'D': 'MRI', 'E': 'Tissue plasminogen activator'}",C,"The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with a severe headache that is worse when laying down, transient vision loss, and blurry vision. She also reports tinnitus. Her past medical history includes obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for an elevated blood pressure of 149/92 mmHg. The initial head CT is normal. The clinical presentation is suggestive of a condition called idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, which is characterized by increased intracranial pressure. The most appropriate next step in management for IIH is to perform a lumbar puncture to measure the opening pressure and to rule out other causes of increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the answer is C) Lumbar puncture.",C,True
"A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?","{'A': 'Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO', 'B': 'Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation', 'C': 'Barium swallow to characterize the depth of mucosal involvement', 'D': 'Esophageal manometry and impedance studies', 'E': 'Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter'}",B,"The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently intoxicated. He presents with hematemesis, which is vomiting of bright red blood. His vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia. The endoscopy reveals mild esophagitis and a longitudinal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, known as a Mallory-Weiss tear, with no active bleeding.

Given the absence of active bleeding, the next best course of action would be conservative management. This includes IV fluid hydration to prevent dehydration and observation for any signs of re-bleeding. The tear itself will typically heal without intervention.

Therefore, the answer is B) Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation.",B,True
A researcher is studying risk factors for open-angle glaucoma in a group of elderly patients at a primary care clinic. He is curious if patients with diabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL on two separate readings) are at increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma over time. Which of the following is the best statement of the null hypothesis for this study?,"{'A': 'The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes', 'B': 'Having diabetes will not cause changes in risk of future open-angle glaucoma', 'C': 'Diabetes is not associated with an increased prevalence of open-angle glaucoma', 'D': 'The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes', 'E': 'Improved adherence to antidiabetics will not be effective in decreasing future open-angle glaucoma risk'}",A,The correct answer is A) The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes.,A,True

Let's review the options:

A) A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism: This is a contraindication for IUDs because it increases the risk of another thromboembolic event.
B) Current tobacco use: While smoking is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is not an absolute contraindication for IUD placement.
C) Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID is a contraindication for IUD placement because the device could potentially worsen the infection.
D) Past medical history of breast cancer: A history of breast cancer is not a contraindication for IUD placement unless it was hormone receptor-positive and the patient is taking hormone therapy.
E) Known liver neoplasm: A liver neoplasm is not a contraindication for IUD placement unless there is a concern for metastasis or the patient is immunocompromised.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate option is C) Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) because an IUD could exacerbate the infection. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,True
"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm³, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm³), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?","{'A': 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'B': 'Streptococcus pyogene', 'C': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'D': 'Neisseria meningitidis', 'E': 'Non-typeable H. influenzae'}",C,"The patient presented with fever, diarrhea, dyspnea, cyanosis, hypotension, and evidence of disseminated coagulation, which suggests a severe systemic infection. The chest X-ray findings of interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities and the laboratory results indicating metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated coagulation are consistent with sepsis and possibly septic shock. The peripheral smear likely showed findings consistent with the causative organism. The autopsy gram stain revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, the answer is C) Streptococcus pneumoniae.",C,True
A 72-year-old anthropologist with long-standing hypertension visits your office for a routine exam. You notice an abnormality on his laboratory results caused by his regimen of captopril and triamterene. What abnormality did you most likely find?,"{'A': 'Hypercalcemia', 'B': 'Hyperkalemia', 'C': 'Hypernatremia', 'D': 'Thrombocytopenia', 'E': 'Anemia'}",B,"The patient is taking captopril and triamterene. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor, which can lead to hyperkalemia by reducing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby decreasing aldosterone secretion. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which also can cause hyperkalemia by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules of the kidney, leading to increased potassium retention. Therefore, the most likely abnormality on the laboratory results due to this regimen is hyperkalemia. The answer is B) Hyperkalemia.",B,True
"A 61-year-old man comes to the physician with several months of sharp, shooting pain in both legs. Twenty years ago, he had a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment. He has no history of serious illness. Examination shows small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. His gait is unsteady and broad-based. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?","{'A': 'Atrioventricular block', 'B': 'Mitral valve regurgitation', 'C': 'Penile squamous cell carcinoma', 'D': 'Inflammatory polyarthritis', 'E': 'Thoracic aortic aneurysm'}",E,"The patient's history of a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment suggests a possible diagnosis of neurosyphilis, which is consistent with his current symptoms, including sharp, shooting pain in both legs, small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light, decreased sensation over the distal lower extremities, absent patellar reflexes, and an unsteady, broad-based gait. Neurosyphilis can lead to tabes dorsalis, a form of neurosyphilis that affects the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and can cause the described neurological symptoms.

Patients with neurosyphilis are at increased risk for cardiovascular complications, including aortitis and subsequent thoracic aortic aneurysm. Therefore, the correct answer is E) Thoracic aortic aneurysm.",E,True
"A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient’s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses.

These findings suggest a possible diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder. Among the options provided, the one that is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly involving the colon, is Menetrier disease. Menetrier disease is characterized by giant hypertrophic gastritis and protein-losing enteropathy, and it can also involve the colon with features such as colonic mucosal outpouchings. Therefore, the answer is E) Menetrier disease.",E,False
"A 31-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of acute onset neck pain and enlargement. Specifically, he reports that he has been experiencing pain and swelling of the anterior portion of his neck near the midline. Otherwise, he says that he has been getting tired easily and feels cold often. Physical exam reveals a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules. A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?","{'A': 'HLA-B8 risk factor', 'B': 'Increased 131-iodine uptake', 'C': 'Iodine deficiency', 'D': 'Presence of embryological remnant', 'E': 'Proliferation of fibroinflammatory cells'}",C,"The patient's symptoms of acute onset neck pain and enlargement, along with fatigue and cold intolerance, suggest a thyroid-related issue. The physical exam findings of a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with multiple small nodules and the biopsy showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia are consistent with subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis. This condition is often associated with a painful and tender thyroid gland, transient hyperthyroidism, and eventual resolution with a smaller thyroid size.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is not related to iodine deficiency (C), as this condition typically presents with a goiter but not with the acute onset of pain and tenderness. It is also not associated with the presence of embryological remnants (D), which would suggest a different type of thyroid nodule or mass. Proliferation of fibroinflammatory cells (E) is more characteristic of conditions like Riedel's thyroiditis or other forms of chronic thyroiditis, which do not present acutely.

The correct answer is (A) HLA-B8 risk factor. Subacute thyroiditis has been associated with certain HLA haplotypes, including HLA-B8. This genetic marker can be seen in autoimmune conditions, and the presence of HLA-B8 may contribute to the development of subacute thyroiditis.",C,True
"A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?","{'A': 'CT chest without contrast in 12 months', 'B': 'CT chest without contrast in 24 months', 'C': 'Positive emission tomography (PET) of chest now', 'D': 'Right middle lobectomy now', 'E': 'Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now'}",C,"The patient has a calcified nodule in the right middle lobe that has been stable in size over a 1-year period. Calcified nodules are often benign, and the lack of growth (the nodule increased from 8 mm to 10 mm over 1 year) makes malignancy less likely. The appropriate management for a stable, calcified pulmonary nodule is to follow up with imaging at a later date. The recommended interval for follow-up is typically 12 to 24 months, depending on the size and characteristics of the nodule. Since the nodule is less than 1 cm (10 mm), a 24-month follow-up is appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B) CT chest without contrast in 24 months.",B,False
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother after she found him somnolent at home next to multiple open pill bottles. The boy had seemingly opened several different pill bottles that were in a cabinet in his parent’s bathroom. The mother has brought the empty bottles to the emergency room, and they include aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. The boy has no past medical history and takes no medications. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 28/min. On exam, the boy is lethargic but responsive. He appears to be grasping at his ears and swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate. He vomited once in the emergency room. Which of the following arterial blood gas readings is most likely to be found in this patient?","{'A': 'pH 7.29, PCO2 47 mmHg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L', 'B': 'pH 7.35, PCO2 29 mmHg, and HCO3- 15 mEq/L', 'C': 'pH 7.36, PCO2 22 mmHg, and HCO3- 16 mEq/L', 'D': 'pH 7.47, PCO2 41 mmHg, and HCO3- 29 mEq/L', 'E': 'pH 7.48, PCO2 24 mmHg, and HCO3- 25 mEq/L'}",C,"The boy has ingested multiple medications, including aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. Aspirin (salicylate) overdose can lead to a mixed acid-base disorder, initially causing respiratory alkalosis due to direct stimulation of the respiratory center leading to hyperventilation (as evidenced by the boy's increased respiratory rate). As the overdose progresses, metabolic acidosis can develop due to accumulation of organic acids. The clinical presentation of the boy, including lethargy, vomiting, and the described posture, suggests CNS involvement, which is more consistent with a metabolic acidosis secondary to salicylate toxicity.

Given this information, we can rule out options B, C, D, and E, which represent normal pH or metabolic alkalosis. Option A (pH 7.29, PCO2 47 mmHg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L) represents a primary metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis, which is consistent with early aspirin poisoning. However, as the boy has progressed to lethargy and vomiting, he may be developing a mixed picture, with respiratory compensation no longer being fully effective.

The most likely arterial blood gas reading for this patient would be one that reflects a primary metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Among the given options, option A best fits this scenario. Therefore, the answer is A.",A,False
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?","{'A': 'External orbital radiation', 'B': 'Selenium supplementation', 'C': 'Smoking cessation', 'D': 'Systemic corticosteroids', 'E': 'Treatment with radioactive iodine'}",E,"The patient's symptoms of tearing, foreign body sensation, eyelid retraction, limited extraocular motility, and proptosis, along with a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone level and elevated total T4, are consistent with Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder associated with thyroid disease. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin positivity supports this diagnosis. The enlargement of the extraocular muscles with sparing of the tendons is also characteristic of Graves' ophthalmopathy.

Smoking is a known risk factor for the development and worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Therefore, smoking cessation would most likely transiently worsen this patient's eye symptoms due to the inflammatory response that can occur when smoking is stopped.

The answer is C) Smoking cessation.",C,False
A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of cough and progressively worsening difficulty walking up the stairs in his apartment. He has noticed that it is easier for him to climb the stairs after he has exercised. He has also had a 4.6-kg (10.1-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"{'A': 'Polymyalgia rheumatica', 'B': 'Myasthenia gravis', 'C': 'Dermatomyositis', 'D': 'Hypothyroidism', 'E': 'Lambert-Eaton syndrome'}",E,"The patient's history of long-term smoking and the presence of cough suggest a possible lung pathology. The worsening difficulty in walking up stairs that improves with exercise is a characteristic feature of muscle weakness that improves with activity, which is seen in Lambert-Eaton syndrome. This condition is often associated with malignancies, particularly small cell lung cancer, which could explain the weight loss. The dry mucous membranes and sluggish pupillary reaction may indicate an anticholinergic effect, which is seen in Lambert-Eaton syndrome. The increased muscle strength after repeated tapping is also a feature of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is E) Lambert-Eaton syndrome.",E,True
"An obese 42-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a complaint of left knee pain for the past 3 months. She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","{'A': 'Stress fracture of proximal tibia', 'B': 'Medial meniscus tear', 'C': 'Medical collateral ligament (MCL) sprain', 'D': 'Pes anserine bursitis', 'E': 'Patellar tendonitis'}",D,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of pes anserine bursitis. The patient complains of pain on the inside part of the knee as well as the front of the knee, which is worse when climbing stairs or rising from a chair. The location of tenderness over the anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line, is consistent with pes anserine bursitis. Additionally, the absence of joint effusion and negative valgus stress test make other options less likely. Radiographs showing mild arthritis but no fractures or bony lesions further support the diagnosis of pes anserine bursitis. Therefore, the answer is D) Pes anserine bursitis.",D,True
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?","{'A': 'Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy', 'B': 'Dietary restriction of phenylalanine', 'C': 'Daily allopurinol intake', 'D': 'Avoidance of fasting states', 'E': 'High doses of vitamin B6'}",B,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize phenylalanine due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which can cause neurological symptoms, including seizures, if not managed. The musty odor is due to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites. The condition is typically screened for at birth, and early treatment with dietary restriction of phenylalanine can prevent the development of symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.",B,True
"A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain for 5 weeks. He has had up to 4 bowel movements per day. Several times he noticed mucoid strings with the stool. He has abdominal bloating. Over the past month, has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. He has not had fever, cough, or bloody stools. He had a painful rash on his lower extremity 3 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. He works as a pharmacy technician. His temperature is 37.3°C (98.8°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 115/77 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.9 g/dL, MCV is 79 fL, ferritin is 106 ng/dL, and platelet count is 410,000/mm3; serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following findings?","{'A': 'Mucosal lactase deficiency', 'B': 'Increased serum VIP', 'C': 'Stool leukocytes', 'D': 'Melanosis coli', 'E': 'Normal intestinal mucosa'}",C,"The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and a history of a spontaneously resolving painful rash on the lower extremity. The absence of fever, cough, or bloody stools makes an infectious etiology less likely. The presence of mucoid strings with the stool and abdominal bloating suggests a malabsorption syndrome. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low with a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which may indicate anemia of chronic disease or iron deficiency anemia. The normal serum glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes rule out diabetes mellitus, renal failure, or electrolyte imbalance as causes of his symptoms.

The patient's occupation as a pharmacy technician does not directly suggest a specific diagnosis. However, the history of a painful rash that resolved spontaneously could be suggestive of an autoimmune process.

Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, the presence of mucoid strings with the stool, and the normal intestinal mucosa on biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Of the options provided, the one that fits best with this clinical picture is:

D) Melanosis coli - This condition is associated with chronic laxative abuse, which can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. It is characterized by the presence of mucoid strings (stercobilinogen) in the stool due to the accumulation of bile pigments in the colon. The normal intestinal mucosa on biopsy helps rule out inflammatory or infectious causes.

Therefore, the answer is D) Melanosis coli.",D,False
"A 77-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion and unusual behavior for 2 days. She has been mumbling to herself and wandering around the neighborhood. These symptoms are worse in the evenings and she has hardly slept at night. She has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days. She has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.

These symptoms are worse in the evenings, suggesting a possible circadian rhythm disturbance. The fact that she has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days raises concern for possible dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. Her blood glucose concentration is normal, which helps rule out hypoglycemia as a cause of her symptoms.

Given the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step in management would be to check serum electrolytes (Option C) to assess for any imbalances that could be contributing to her symptoms. Electrolyte disturbances, such as hyponatremia or hyperkalemia, can cause confusion and altered mental status, especially in the elderly. This is a non-invasive test and can provide immediate information that may guide further management.

Therefore, the answer is B) Left circumflex artery.",B,True
"A 9-year-old boy is brought to a physician by his mother for evaluation of generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst. The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. He recently had a urinalysis that showed elevated urinary calcium excretion.
Additional lab testing results are as follows:
Serum electrolytes
Sodium 135 mEq/L
Potassium 3.2 mEq/L
Chloride 95 mEq/L
Plasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr)
Plasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)
What is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Renal artery stenosis', 'B': 'Primary hyperaldosteronism', 'C': ""Bartter's syndrome"", 'D': 'Pheochromocytoma', 'E': ""Gitelman's syndrome""}",C,"The patient presents with generalized weakness, increased urination, increased thirst, fatigue, and a preference for sedentary activities. Additionally, the patient has a history of constipation since birth and frequent cravings for salty foods. The elevated urinary calcium excretion and the abnormal lab results showing hypokalemia (low potassium), metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate), and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone activities are significant. These findings suggest an issue with renal handling of electrolytes.

Option A, Renal artery stenosis, typically presents with hypertension and is less likely to cause the electrolyte abnormalities seen in this patient.

Option B, Primary hyperaldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome, is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. However, it is rare in children and does not typically present with the patient's symptoms or elevated plasma renin activity.

Option C, Bartter's syndrome, is a group of rare inherited disorders that affect the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. Patients with Bartter's syndrome often present with symptoms similar to those of this patient, including hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and normal to low blood pressure. However, they typically have low levels of aldosterone, which is not consistent with this patient's elevated aldosterone levels.

Option D, Pheochromocytoma, is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes excess catecholamines, leading to episodes of hypertension, headaches, sweating, and palpitations. This patient does not have these symptoms, and the lab results do not support this diagnosis.

Option E, Gitelman's syndrome, is an inherited disorder characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia. Patients with Gitelman's syndrome often present with symptoms similar to those of this patient, including fatigue, weakness, and salt cravings. However, Gitelman's syndrome typically presents later in life and is associated with low levels of aldosterone, which is not consistent with this patient's elevated aldosterone levels.",A,False
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient says he feels as if he is unable to take a deep breath. The patient has a past medical history of COPD and a 44-pack-year smoking history. The patient has been admitted before for a similar presentation. His temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 33/min, and oxygen saturation is 80% on room air. The patient is started on 100% oxygen, albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, and prednisone. The patient claims he is still short of breath. Physical exam reveals bilateral wheezes and poor air movement. His oxygen saturation is 80%. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","{'A': 'BiPAP', 'B': 'Chest radiograph', 'C': 'Chest tube placement', 'D': 'Intubation', 'E': 'Needle decompression'}",A,"The patient is presenting with shortness of breath, a history of COPD, and a significant smoking history. The vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. The patient has been started on appropriate medications for an acute exacerbation of COPD, including bronchodilators, steroids, and supplemental oxygen. Despite these interventions, the patient remains short of breath and has a low oxygen saturation. The physical exam findings of bilateral wheezes and poor air movement suggest a severe exacerbation, possibly with respiratory failure.

The options for the next step in management are:
A. BiPAP - Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure can be used in COPD patients to improve ventilation and oxygenation.
B. Chest radiograph - This could be useful to rule out other causes of respiratory distress, such as pneumonia or pneumothorax.
C. Chest tube placement - This would be indicated if there was evidence of a pneumothorax or pleural effusion causing respiratory distress.
D. Intubation - This is a procedure where a tube is placed through the mouth into the airway to assist with ventilation. It is indicated in cases of severe respiratory failure when other interventions are not effective.
E. Needle decompression - This is performed in cases of suspected tension pneumothorax, where air is decompressed from the pleural space to relieve pressure on the heart and lungs.

Given the patient's severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen and medication, the best next step in management would be to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation. Intubation would be the most appropriate intervention to ensure the patient's airway is protected and oxygenation is optimized.

Therefore, the answer is D) Intubation.",D,False
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of headaches for the past 2 weeks. His headaches tend to occur in the morning and are associated with nausea and vomiting. One month ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity, and he was successfully treated with antibiotics. His temperature today is 37.5°C (98.5°F). An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of the patient's condition?","{'A': 'Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus', 'B': 'Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations', 'C': 'Impaired CSF drainage into the subarachnoid space', 'D': 'Impaired CSF drainage into the fourth ventricle', 'E': 'Compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces'}",B,"The patient's history of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity one month ago, which was successfully treated with antibiotics, suggests a possible case of meningitis. The MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space indicate hydrocephalus, which is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ventricles and subarachnoid space.

The most likely explanation for the patient's condition is impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations. The arachnoid granulations are responsible for the absorption of CSF into the venous system. If there is an impairment in this process, such as following meningitis, it can lead to a buildup of CSF and subsequent hydrocephalus.

Therefore, the answer is B) Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations.",B,True
"Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face.

Orlistat works by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, which is necessary for the digestion of dietary fats. By inhibiting lipase, orlistat reduces the absorption of fats, leading to weight loss. The greasy diarrhea is due to the malabsorption of fats, and the dry skin and night-time vision changes are related to the deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A) that can occur with fat malabsorption. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking is inhibition of lipase. The answer is D) Inhibition of lipase.",D,True
"A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness.

He has tried non-pharmacological measures to reduce nocturia without success. The absence of suprapubic mass or tenderness and costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination suggests that the kidneys and bladder are not involved. The most common cause of urinary symptoms in men at this age is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but other causes such as urinary tract infection (UTI), prostate cancer, or bladder pathology should be considered.

The best next step in management would be to perform a urinalysis and serum creatinine (Option A) to evaluate for urinary tract infection or other renal pathology. This is a non-invasive test that can provide immediate information about the patient's renal function and help rule out infection or other causes of his symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is A) Urinalysis and serum creatinine.",A,False
"A 10-year-old girl is brought to a clinic by her parents after 1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers. She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy?","{'A': 'Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity', 'B': 'gag gene mutation', 'C': 'env gene mutation', 'D': 'pol gene mutation', 'E': 'Decreased viral replication'}",D,"The patient is a 10-year-old girl with a history of HIV infection who is presenting with symptoms of difficulty breathing, dry cough, low-grade fevers, and oral ulcers. She is on HAART therapy and has a baseline viral load of <50/mL, indicating effective antiretroviral therapy. However, her current viral load is significantly elevated at 25,050/mL, suggesting a lack of responsiveness to therapy. The patient's CD4 count is also low at 100/mm3, indicating a compromised immune system.

The most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy in this case is related to the HIV virus itself. The options given are different mechanisms by which HIV can evade the immune system or become resistant to antiretroviral therapy.

Option A (Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity) refers to a failure of the immune system's cytotoxic T cells to effectively kill infected cells, which is not directly related to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy.

Option B (gag gene mutation) refers to a mutation in the gag gene of the HIV virus, which codes for structural proteins. Mutations in this gene can lead to resistance to certain classes of antiretroviral drugs, such as protease inhibitors.

Option C (env gene mutation) refers to a mutation in the env gene of the HIV virus, which codes for envelope proteins. Mutations in this gene can lead to resistance to entry inhibitors.

Option D (pol gene mutation) refers to a mutation in the pol gene of the HIV virus, which codes for enzymes necessary for viral replication. Mutations in this gene can lead to resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors.

Option E (Decreased viral replication) is not a mechanism of resistance but rather the desired effect of effective antiretroviral therapy.

Given that the patient has a significantly elevated viral load despite being on HAART, the most likely cause is a mutation in one of the genes responsible for viral replication. Among the options provided, the pol gene mutation is the most common cause of resistance to antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients.

Therefore, the answer is D)",A,False

The negative stool occult blood test and abdominal ultrasonography rule out gastrointestinal bleeding as the cause of the anemia. The patient's insistence on having cancer despite no evidence of it on examination or imaging, as well as her request for an invasive procedure without any clear indication, may suggest a psychological issue. The presence of numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins could indicate self-injury or factitious disorder. The grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur could be related to her anemia. Given the combination of psychological symptoms, physical findings suggestive of self-injury, and anemia likely due to blood loss, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder.

Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are mostly like due to maternal use of which of the following?","{'A': 'GABAA receptor agonist', 'B': 'Mu receptor agonist', 'C': 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist', 'D': 'Monoamine reuptake antagonist', 'E': 'Thyroperoxidase inhibitor'}",B,"The symptoms described in the newborn, including high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, are suggestive of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a withdrawal syndrome that can occur in newborns who are exposed to certain substances in utero. In this case, the most likely cause of NAS is maternal drug use.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) GABAA receptor agonist: This class of drugs is typically used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. While withdrawal from GABAA receptor agonists can cause symptoms like irritability and tremors, the presentation is less consistent with the symptoms described in the newborn.

B) Mu receptor agonist: This refers to opioids, which are commonly abused substances that can lead to NAS when used during pregnancy. The symptoms of NAS, including hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, are consistent with opioid withdrawal.

C) Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist: This is not a commonly recognized category of drugs associated with NAS.

D) Monoamine reuptake antagonist: These drugs are primarily used as antidepressants and are not typically associated with NAS.

E) Thyroperoxidase inhibitor: These substances inhibit the thyroid hormone synthesis and are not commonly associated with NAS.

Based on the symptoms described and the common causes of NAS, the most likely maternal drug use leading to these symptoms is a mu receptor agonist, which is an opioid. Therefore, the answer is B) Mu receptor agonist.",B,True
"A 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. She has had multiple episodes of upper abdominal pain over the past year. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Perforation of the duodenal wall', 'B': 'Inflammation of the gallbladder wall', 'C': 'Obstruction of the common bile duct', 'D': 'Occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery', 'E': 'Torsion of the large intestine'}",B,"The patient's symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation, along with the physical examination findings of a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds, suggest an intestinal obstruction. The x-ray findings of a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region are indicative of a mass effect causing the obstruction.

Option A (Perforation of the duodenal wall) would typically present with acute, severe, and generalized abdominal pain due to peritonitis, rather than intermittent symptoms and a distended abdomen with high-pitched bowel sounds.

Option B (Inflammation of the gallbladder wall) or cholecystitis would not explain the x-ray findings of a dilated bowel and branching radiolucencies.

Option C (Obstruction of the common bile duct) would more likely present with jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools, rather than the gastrointestinal obstruction symptoms seen in this patient.

Option D (Occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery) would lead to ischemia of the bowel, which typically presents with severe abdominal pain, fever, and signs of peritonitis, not intermittent symptoms and a distended abdomen with high-pitched bowel sounds.

Option E (Torsion of the large intestine) could explain the x-ray findings and the patient's symptoms, as it would cause a mass effect leading to bowel obstruction. The history of multiple episodes of upper abdominal pain over the past year could be related to intermittent torsion and subsequent detorsion of the large intestine.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is torsion of the large intestine. The answer is E) Torsion of the large intestine.",A,False

"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration.

CJD is a prion disease, which is a type of infection that can be transmitted via contaminated tissue, such as during a corneal transplant. Prions contain abnormal genetic material that causes the disease but are unable to replicate on their own and thus require a host to survive. They do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan, which is characteristic of bacteria, and are not typically associated with longstanding hypertension. The hallmark of CJD is the development of spongiform encephalopathy, which is characterized by the accumulation of prion proteins in the brain, leading to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?,"{'A': 'Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity', 'B': 'Increased hemoglobin breakdown', 'C': 'Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption', 'D': 'Defective hepatic bile excretion', 'E': 'Presence of stones within the gallbladder'}",D,"The patient presents with jaundice and scleral icterus, which are signs of increased bilirubin. The urinalysis findings of elevated bilirubin and low urobilinogen suggest that the bilirubin is not being processed normally in the liver. This points to a problem with hepatic processing of bilirubin rather than an issue with hemoglobin breakdown, intestinal reabsorption, or gallstones. Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity is a cause of jaundice due to Gilbert's syndrome, but this condition typically presents with mild, chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and not with the acute symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of these findings is defective hepatic bile excretion, which is associated with conditions such as cholestasis.

Cardiac tamponade is a condition where blood, fluid, or exudates fill the pericardial space, leading to impaired filling of the heart during diastole. This can cause muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. The drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) is a classic finding in cardiac tamponade. This is due to the impaired filling of the right ventricle during inspiration when intrathoracic pressure decreases, leading to a greater decrease in the pressure within the pericardial space compared to the right ventricle, resulting in a transient decrease in cardiac output and a drop in blood pressure.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be a drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration, which is consistent with pulsus paradoxus seen in cardiac tamponade.

The answer is C) A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration.",C,True
"A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?","{'A': 'Irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase enzyme', 'B': 'Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells', 'C': 'Irreversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors', 'D': 'Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells', 'E': 'Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors'}",B,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is characterized by the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, causing heartburn and chest pain. The patient's initial improvement with cimetidine, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, suggests that his GERD was previously controlled by this medication.

Cimetidine works by reversibly inhibiting histamine H2 receptors on parietal cells in the stomach, which decreases the production of stomach acid. Since the patient's symptoms have returned, it is likely that his new medication will also be an H2 receptor antagonist to continue controlling his GERD.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the new medication prescribed to the patient is reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors. The answer is E) Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors.",E,False

The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed. Which of the structures below gives rise to the defective structure that is causing this patient’s symptoms?","{'A': 'Aortopulmonary septum', 'B': 'Endocardial cushion', 'C': 'Infundibular septum', 'D': '3rd pharyngeal arch', 'E': 'Rathke’s pouch'}",B,"The patient presents with symptoms of easy fatigability, difficulty breathing, and short stature. The presence of a localized harsh pansystolic murmur that becomes louder with squatting suggests a defect in the cardiac structure that is associated with increased blood flow during squatting. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a congenital heart defect. The murmur described is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a defect in the septum that separates the left and right ventricles of the heart. The infundibular septum is part of the membranous ventricular septum and is the structure that gives rise to the VSD in this patient. Therefore, the answer is C) Infundibular septum.",C,False
"A man is brought into the emergency department by the police department. The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically.

Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?","{'A': 'Ethanol', 'B': 'Naltrexone', 'C': 'Naloxone', 'D': 'Flumazenil', 'E': 'Fomepizole'}",E,"The patient presents with confusion, ataxia, and slurred speech, which are signs of intoxication. However, the labs show a normal sodium level and normal blood salicylate levels, which rules out hyponatremia and salicylate poisoning as causes of his symptoms. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.3, which is acidic, a PaCO2 of 13 mm Hg, which is low, and a PaO2 of 130 mm Hg, which is normal. The HCO3 is also low at 7, suggesting a metabolic acidosis. The low PaCO2 indicates a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. The urinalysis would provide additional clues, but since it's not actually shown here, we can't use it to make a decision.

Given the clinical presentation and the ABG results, the patient appears to be in a state of metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. This could be due to an accumulation of organic acids, such as those seen in alcoholic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis.

The treatment options listed are:
A) Ethanol - used in cases of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning to prevent the formation of toxic metabolites.
B) Naltrexone - an opioid antagonist used in the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence.
C) Naloxone - an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose.
D) Flumazenil - a benzodiazepine antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine overdose.
E) Fomepizole - an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor used in the treatment of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning.

Considering the patient's presentation and the need to address the metabolic acidosis, the most appropriate treatment would be to inhibit the metabolism of alcohol to its toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for converting these alcohols into their toxic metabolites.

The fact that the patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing indicates a deficit in the inner ear or the neural pathways to the brain.

The physical examination findings that the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable further support the likelihood of a sensorineural rather than a conductive hearing loss.

The Rinne test results, where air conduction is greater than bone conduction, are normal. This suggests that there is no conductive hearing loss component.

Given these considerations, the structure most likely impaired in this patient is the cochlea, which is responsible for converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.

The fact that he recently traveled to South America and has had contact with others who had influenza may be red herrings, as his clinical presentation is more consistent with a bacterial pneumonia than a viral one.

The presence of a deep noise at the lung bases and bilateral lung infiltrates on the chest radiograph further supports the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Now, let's consider the options provided to identify the characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms:

A. Captain's wheel appearance - This is characteristic of Legionella pneumophila, which is often associated with contaminated water sources such as air conditioning systems or hot tubs.

B. Cultured on charcoal and yeast - This is a method used for culturing Histoplasma capsulatum, a fungus that causes histoplasmosis, typically found in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.

C. D-glutamate capsule - This is a characteristic of Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium that causes whooping cough, not typically associated with the patient's presentation.

D. Found in desert sand - This is characteristic of Coccidioides immitis, the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis or Valley fever, which is endemic to the Southwestern United States and parts of Central and South America.

E. Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule - This is a characteristic of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common cause of pneumonia, especially in patients with alcohol use disorder.

Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that he recently traveled to South America, the most likely organism responsible for his symptoms is Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium is known to cause pneumonia with a characteristic polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule.

Therefore, the answer is E) Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule.",E,False

His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?","{'A': 'Lowering citalopram dose', 'B': 'Addition of bupropion', 'C': 'Switch to fluoxetine', 'D': 'Addition of sildenafil', 'E': 'Switch to selegiline'}",A,"The patient has generalized anxiety disorder and is being treated with citalopram. He reports improvement in his symptoms but has developed sexual dysfunction (weak tumescence and low libido) in the past 2 months. Sexual dysfunction is a known side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. The most appropriate step in the management of this patient would be to address this side effect.

Option A (Lowering citalopram dose) could be considered if the dose was high and the patient was experiencing other side effects or if the current dose was minimally effective for the anxiety symptoms. However, there is no information provided that the current dose is ineffective for the anxiety symptoms.

Option B (Addition of bupropion) is a reasonable choice because bupropion is an antidepressant that does not typically cause sexual dysfunction and can be added to help with sexual side effects caused by SSRIs.

Option C (Switch to fluoxetine) is not appropriate because fluoxetine is another SSRI and is also known to cause sexual dysfunction.

Option D (Addition of sildenafil) is used to treat erectile dysfunction but does not address the low libido. It is also not the first-line treatment for sexual dysfunction caused by SSRIs.

Option E (Switch to selegiline) is not appropriate because selegiline is an MAO inhibitor and has significant drug interactions with SSRIs, which can lead to serotonin syndrome.

Therefore, the most appropriate option to address the patient's sexual dysfunction while continuing treatment for his anxiety disorder is to add a medication that is less likely to cause sexual side effects.

The answer is (B) Addition of bupropion.",A,True

Class I patients have no symptoms and are able to carry on all physical activities without discomfort. Class II patients have slight limitations on physical activity and are comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class IIa patients are able to carry on all physical activities without discomfort, but less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class IIb patients are comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class III patients have marked limitations on physical activity and are comfortable only at rest. Class IV patients cannot carry on any physical activity without discomfort and are usually confined to bed or a chair.

Based on the information provided, the patient is unable to go for short walks and finds simple tasks like getting ready in the morning burdensome. This indicates that she has marked limitations on physical activity. She is comfortable only at rest. Therefore, her New York Heart Association Functional Classification is Class III.

The answer is D) New York Heart Association Class III.",D,True
"A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department after collapsing during a cheerleading practice session. Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy', 'B': 'In-patient medical therapy', 'C': 'In-patient psychiatric therapy', 'D': 'Antidepressants', 'E': 'Appetite stimulants'}",A,"The patient's presentation with a low blood pressure, bradycardia, and denial of being underweight despite being anorexic suggests an eating disorder, possibly anorexia nervosa. The best long-term management for anorexia nervosa involves a multidisciplinary approach, which includes nutritional rehabilitation, psychological therapy, and monitoring of medical stability. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based psychological treatment for eating disorders and can be part of the long-term management plan. However, given the severity of the patient's condition with hemodynamic instability, the initial management would involve medical stabilization and refeeding, which may be done in an in-patient setting. Therefore, the most appropriate option for long-term management among the given choices is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Hence, the answer is A) Cognitive-behavioral therapy.",A,True

In dehydration, the body attempts to conserve water. The primary site of sodium reabsorption in the kidneys is the proximal tubule, where approximately 65-70% of the filtered sodium load is reabsorbed. This helps to conserve water by reducing the volume of urine produced. The other options (A, B, C, and E) represent sites where sodium is also reabsorbed, but to a lesser extent compared to the proximal tubule. Therefore, the answer is D) Proximal tubule.",D,True
"A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. The patient lives with her son and his family and her son reports that other members of the family have had similar symptoms during the past week but that he has not had any symptoms. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the woman is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?","{'A': 'Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin', 'B': 'Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression', 'C': 'Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions', 'D': 'Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene', 'E': 'High concentration of circulating T cells'}",A,"The patient's symptoms and the PCR test results suggest an infection with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome, which is characteristic of influenza. The son being asymptomatic despite exposure could be due to either genetic resistance or prior immunity. The options provided relate to different mechanisms by which an individual might be protected from viral infection.

Option A refers to serum antibodies against hemagglutinin, which is a surface protein of the influenza virus. Having antibodies against hemagglutinin would provide immunity to the virus, which could explain why the son is asymptomatic.

Option B refers to downregulation of ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 is a cellular receptor that some viruses use to enter cells. Downregulation of ICAM-1 could potentially protect cells from viral infection, but this is not a known specific mechanism of resistance to influenza.

Option C refers to protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions. These antibodies can neutralize viruses, but influenza virus is not typically sensitive to protease inactivation, so this would not explain resistance to influenza.

Option D refers to a homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene. A mutation in the CCR5 gene confers resistance to HIV infection, not influenza.

Option E refers to a high concentration of circulating T cells. While T cells are important in the immune response to viral infections, a high concentration of T cells is not a specific protective mechanism against influenza.

Given the information provided and the characteristics of the influenza virus, the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms is that he has serum antibodies against hemagglutinin, which would provide immunity to the virus. Therefore, the answer is A) Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin.",A,True
"A 44-year-old man presents to the family medicine clinic for some small bumps on his left thigh. The lesions are non-pruritic and have been present for the last 3 weeks.

He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and uses intravenous street drugs. His heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, the temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), and the blood pressure is 126/80 mm Hg. Auscultation of the heart is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Three 2-3 mm, dome-shaped, hardened papules are noted on the left thigh. Central umbilication can be observed in each papule. There is a non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Kaposi sarcoma', 'B': 'Bed bug bite', 'C': 'Molluscum contagiosum', 'D': 'Atopic dermatitis', 'E': 'Acute urticaria'}",C,"The patient presents with small, dome-shaped, hardened papules with central umbilication on his thigh and non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy. These clinical features are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum, a viral infection caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), which is a member of the poxvirus family. The lesions of molluscum contagiosum typically appear as small, firm, dome-shaped, and umbilicated papules. The infection is commonly spread through direct contact or autoinoculation. The patient's history of intravenous drug use may increase his risk of acquiring skin infections, including molluscum contagiosum. Kaposi sarcoma is a malignancy associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and typically presents as red or purple patches on the skin. Bed bug bites would be more likely to cause pruritic lesions and are not typically umbilicated. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritic, eczematous plaques, and is not typically associated with umbilicated papules. Acute urticaria presents as transient, pruritic wheals that can appear anywhere on the body and are not typically umbilicated. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C) Molluscum contagiosum.",C,True
A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?,"{'A': 'Botulism', 'B': 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'C': 'Hypothyroidism', 'D': 'Myasthenia gravis', 'E': 'Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung'}",E,"The patient is a 65-year-old woman presenting with weight loss and weakness that is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair, and improves after brief exercise. Additionally, she has bladder incontinence that has not improved with the use of an anticholinesterase agent. Based on these symptoms, the most likely cause is D) Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness of the voluntary muscles, which typically improves with rest and worsens with activity. The weakness often involves the ocular and bulbar muscles, and may also affect the respiratory muscles. The improvement in strength after brief exercise is a classic feature of myasthenia gravis. Bladder incontinence can also occur in myasthenia gravis due to involvement of the urinary sphincter. The lack of response to an anticholinesterase agent suggests that the diagnosis is not likely to be botulism, as botulism would typically show some improvement with such treatment. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder that primarily affects boys and presents earlier in life. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and weight gain, but the specific pattern of weakness improving with exercise and the bladder incontinence are not typical features. Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung can cause neurological symptoms, but these are usually more consistent with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which is associated with improvement in strength with exercise.",A,False

The elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells indicates an inflammatory response, likely due to an infection. The most common cause of postpartum infection is endometritis, which is typically caused by a polymicrobial infection including anaerobic bacteria and genital mycoplasma. Among the options provided, the organism that fits the description of a common cause of postpartum infection is Coagulase-negative cocci in clusters, which refers to Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common skin flora that can cause infection in indwelling devices or postoperative infections.

Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Cervical spine fracture', 'B': 'Intracranial hemorrhage', 'C': 'Syringomyelia', 'D': 'Brachial plexopathy', 'E': 'Conversion disorder'}",C,"The patient presents with weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, but normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities. This pattern of symptoms suggests a localized neurological problem affecting the upper extremities. A cervical spine fracture (A) could cause weakness and sensory changes, but it would likely also affect the lower extremities and possibly cause other signs such as bowel or bladder dysfunction. An intracranial hemorrhage (B) is less likely given the absence of symptoms such as headache, altered mental status, or focal neurological deficits. Syringomyelia (C) can cause a 'cape-like' pattern of weakness and sensory loss, typically sparing the lower extremities. Brachial plexopathy (D) can cause weakness and sensory changes in the upper extremities, but it would not typically cause complete weakness in all upper extremity muscles. Conversion disorder (E) is a psychiatric condition that can present with neurological symptoms, but it is less likely given the objective findings on examination. The most likely diagnosis based on the presentation of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities is syringomyelia, which can occur as a result of trauma and may not present immediately after the injury. Therefore, the answer is C) Syringomyelia.",C,True
"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status.

Prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in newborns with certain congenital heart defects. The ductus arteriosus is a normal fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. After birth, it is supposed to close as the newborn starts breathing air and oxygenating its own blood. However, in some congenital heart defects, the ductus arteriosus needs to remain open to ensure adequate blood flow to the body. If the ductus arteriosus closes prematurely, as indicated by the blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes (cyanosis), it suggests that the blood is not getting oxygenated properly. Therefore, the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis is the closure of the ductus arteriosus. The answer is B) Closure of the ductus arteriosus.",B,False
"A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. During this period, the patient has had recurrent episodes of high-grade fever, night sweats, and feelings of fatigue. Two months ago, he had herpes zoster that was treated with acyclovir.

The laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis with lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia further support this. The blood smear showing mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and the flow cytometry results indicating lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23 are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The most appropriate treatment for CLL is a combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen) is a commonly used regimen for CLL. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.",C,True

"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress.

The prenatal history is significant for gestational diabetes and a quadruple screen indicating a high risk for chromosomal abnormalities. The decreased AFI on the last ultrasound prior to labor suggests oligohydramnios, which can be associated with gastrointestinal obstruction. The physical exam findings of a firm and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds further support the presence of an intestinal obstruction.

The most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation is C) Meconium ileus. Meconium ileus is commonly associated with cystic fibrosis and presents as an obstruction of the ileum due to inspissated (thickened) meconium. It is more common in males and can be associated with a family history of cystic fibrosis. The bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium, and distended abdomen are consistent with this diagnosis.

Duodenal atresia (A) typically presents with bilious vomiting within the first few days of life but is less likely to be associated with a family history of cystic fibrosis. Intestinal malrotation (B) is a surgical emergency and often presents with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension, but it is not typically associated with delayed meconium passage. Necrotizing enterocolitis (D) is more common in preterm infants and is associated with pneumatosis intestinalis on radiography. Pyloric stenosis (E) typically presents with non-bilious vomiting and is not associated with failure to pass meconium.

Therefore, the answer is C) Meconium ileus.",C,False

The most appropriate next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the causative organism. A urinalysis would help identify the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrites, which are indicative of a urinary tract infection. However, in this case, given the severity of symptoms and the costovertebral angle tenderness, a more specific test is needed to confirm pyelonephritis.

A cervical swab is not indicated as there are no symptoms suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection or pelvic inflammatory disease. An abdominal ultrasound may be useful in evaluating for other causes of abdominal pain but is not the most appropriate next step for suspected pyelonephritis. Blood cultures are typically not necessary for uncomplicated pyelonephritis unless the patient is immunocompromised or has severe sepsis. A CT scan of the abdomen is not the first-line imaging modality for suspected pyelonephritis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a urine sample for culture to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy.

The answer is A) Urinalysis.",A,True
"A 55-year-old male visited his primary care physician complaining of chest pain and progressive shortness of breath worsened by exertion. His vital signs were within normal limits. He reports that he worked in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties. A CT scan of his chest shows diffuse thickening of the pleura and a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made. Assuming this diagnosis is correct, which of the following is most likely to also be present in this patient?","{'A': 'Pneumothorax', 'B': 'Pleural effusion', 'C': 'Systemic inflammatory response syndrome', 'D': 'Bronchioalveolar carcinoma', 'E': 'Bronchiectasis'}",B,"The patient has been diagnosed with mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer affecting the pleura. Given this information, we can evaluate the options:

A. Pneumothorax - This is a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall, causing the lung to collapse. While it can be associated with pleural disease, it is not specifically associated with mesothelioma.

B. Pleural effusion - This is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. It is a common complication of mesothelioma due to the involvement of the pleura.

C. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) - This is a serious condition characterized by a widespread inflammatory response throughout the body. It is not specifically associated with mesothelioma.

D. Bronchioalveolar carcinoma - This is a type of lung cancer that affects the small airways and alveoli. It is not directly related to mesothelioma.

E. Bronchiectasis - This is a chronic condition characterized by the abnormal widening of the bronchi, the airways that carry air to and from the lungs. It is not specifically associated with mesothelioma.

Based on the information provided, the most likely additional finding in a patient with mesothelioma would be pleural effusion, as it is a common complication of the disease. Therefore, the answer is B) Pleural effusion.",B,True
"A 28-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?","{'A': ""Raynaud's phenomenon"", 'B': 'Myocardial infarction', 'C': 'Aortic dissection', 'D': 'Costochondritis', 'E': 'Dysphagia'}",A,"The patient's symptoms of episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness, along with transient ST elevations on ECG that resolve completely, are suggestive of Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina). This condition is caused by transient coronary artery spasm, which leads to transient myocardial ischemia. The mechanism behind Prinzmetal's angina is similar to the mechanism of Raynaud's phenomenon, which involves episodic vasospasm of the digital arteries. Therefore, the answer is A) Raynaud's phenomenon.",A,True
"A 24-year-old primigravida presents to her physician at 20 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment 2 weeks ago, and was treated with amoxicillin. She has no concurrent diseases and no complaints. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 82/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.6℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals no abnormalities. On gynecologic examination, the cervix is soft and non-tender with no discharge from the external os. The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?","{'A': 'This patient does not require further urinary tests unless she becomes symptomatic.', 'B': 'Urinalysis should be performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria.', 'C': 'Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.', 'D': 'Perform urine dipstick assay for leukocyte esterase.', 'E': 'Urinalysis should be performed to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria; if positive, perform a urine culture.'}",C,"The patient was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment and was treated with amoxicillin. She is currently asymptomatic with normal vital signs and physical examination. Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis, which can have adverse effects on both the mother and fetus. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for recurrence of bacteriuria. The most appropriate option would be to perform a urine culture to confirm the presence of bacteriuria. This is in line with standard practice for pregnant women with a history of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Urinalysis alone may not be sufficient to detect bacteriuria, as the presence of leukocytes, blood, and bacteria in the urine may not always be present. Therefore, option E, which suggests performing urinalysis to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria, and if positive, perform a urine culture, is the most comprehensive approach. However, it is important to note that the initial screening should be done by culture to confirm the presence of bacteriuria. Therefore, the answer is E) Urinalysis should be performed to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria; if positive, perform a urine culture.",E,False
A 34-year-old man comes to the physician with a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating at work. He is worried he may lose his job due to poor performance. He feels constantly tired but attributes his fatigue to waking up early most mornings and being unable to fall back asleep. His wife has noticed that he has been speaking more slowly than usual and his appetite has decreased. He used to enjoy dance classes with her but has not been as interested in this recently. He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"{'A': 'Major depressive disorder', 'B': 'Persistent depressive disorder', 'C': 'Adjustment disorder', 'D': 'Acute stress disorder', 'E': 'Post traumatic stress disorder'}",A,"The patient presents with a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating, fatigue, insomnia, decreased appetite, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. These symptoms are consistent with a depressive disorder. Given that he is a veteran who returned from deployment 2 years ago, it is important to consider PTSD. However, the duration of symptoms in PTSD is typically less than 1 month after the traumatic event, and symptoms must last for more than 1 month. Since the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 months, this would be more consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (A) rather than PTSD (E). Persistent depressive disorder (B) is characterized by a chronic state of depression lasting at least 2 years, which does not seem to fit the patient's symptom duration. Adjustment disorder (C) is a reaction to a stressful event causing significant emotional or behavioral symptoms, but it typically occurs within 3 months of the stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased. Acute stress disorder (D) involves symptoms similar to PTSD but occurs immediately after the traumatic event and lasts from 3 days to 1 month. Since the patient's symptoms have persisted for 2 months and there is no mention of an acute stressor, major depressive disorder (A) is the most likely diagnosis.",D,False
"A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?","{'A': 'Decreased bronchodilation', 'B': 'Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract', 'C': 'Decreased heart rate', 'D': 'Decreased blood pressure', 'E': 'Increased heart rate'}",C,"The patient in question is diagnosed with hypertension and is being treated with propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker. Beta-blockers block the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) on the beta receptors, which are found in various tissues including the heart and blood vessels. Epinephrine normally acts to increase heart rate (positive chronotropic effect) and increase the force of heart muscle contraction (positive inotropic effect). It also causes bronchodilation (relaxation of the smooth muscles in the airways), increases motility of the gastrointestinal tract, and causes vasoconstriction leading to increased blood pressure.

Given that the patient is on propranolol, the beta-blocking effects of this medication will attenuate the effects of epinephrine. Specifically, it will reduce the heart rate increase and the increase in blood pressure that would normally occur with epinephrine administration. However, since the question asks for the effect of epinephrine treatment, we need to consider the normal physiological effects of epinephrine in the absence of beta-blocker use.

Therefore, the correct answer is E) Increased heart rate.",B,False
"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?","{'A': 'Isoniazid', 'B': 'Fluconazole', 'C': 'Caspofungin', 'D': 'Prednisone', 'E': 'Surgical resection of the infiltrates'}",D,"The patient's history of asthma, coupled with the presence of greenish sputum with red specks, brown mucous plugs, and elevated IgE levels, suggests an allergic component to her respiratory symptoms. The ""glove-finger shadows"" seen on the chest radiograph are indicative of a fungal infection, most likely allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus species that commonly affects patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. The presence of atelectasis in the right lung base may be secondary to obstruction of the airways by mucous plugs or inflammation.

The most appropriate therapy for ABPA is systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which help reduce the inflammatory response and improve lung function. Surgical resection of the infiltrates is not indicated in this case, as the lesions are likely due to the fungal infection rather than a neoplastic process. Antibiotics such as isoniazid and fluconazole, as well as antifungal agents like caspofungin, are not the first-line treatments for ABPA.

Therefore, the answer is D) Prednisone.",D,True
"A 28-year-old woman presents following a suicide attempt 2 days ago. She says that her attempt was a result of a fight with her boyfriend and that she slit her wrists in an attempt to keep him from breaking up with her. In the past, she has had many turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life. Her family members describe her as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people’s feelings. Since she was admitted to the hospital, she has spit at several staff members and alternated between sobbing and anger. She has no significant past medical history. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use.

The history of a suicide attempt, affective instability, and alternating between sobbing and anger are particularly suggestive of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). BPD is a Cluster B personality disorder, which also includes Antisocial Personality Disorder, Histrionic Personality Disorder, and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. However, the patient's symptoms are most characteristic of BPD. Therefore, the answer is B) Borderline personality disorder.",B,True
"A previously healthy 29-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of burning with urination for several days. He has also had pain in the right ankle for 3 days and pain and swelling in the left knee for 1 day. Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?","{'A': 'Circular erythematous rash with central clearing', 'B': 'Pain on passive extension of the fingers', 'C': 'Palpable mass in the right lower quadrant', 'D': 'Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon', 'E': 'Nontender subcutaneous nodules over the olecranon'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of burning with urination, pain in the right ankle, pain and swelling in the left knee, fever, and bloody diarrhea suggest a systemic inflammatory process. The recent history of antibiotic use for bloody diarrhea raises the suspicion of antibiotic-associated colitis, which can be caused by Clostridium difficile. C. difficile colitis can lead to a condition known as reactive arthritis, which is characterized by arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis. Reactive arthritis often affects the lower extremities and can present with pain at the insertion of the Achilles tendon due to enthesitis. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. The answer is D) Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.",D,True
"A 29-year-old G1P0 female presents at 22 weeks gestation for her first prenatal care appointment. Physical exam demonstrates a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?","{'A': 'Renal agenesis', 'B': 'Pulmonary hypoplasia', 'C': 'Duodenal atresia', 'D': 'Posterior urethral valve', 'E': 'Polycystic kidney disease'}",C,The answer is A) Renal agenesis.,A,False
"A previously healthy 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise for the last 6 months. She does not smoke. Her maternal uncle had similar symptoms. Cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2. The second component of S2 is loud and best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation.

This is often due to an atrial septal defect (ASD), which leads to increased left-to-right shunting. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings is increased left-to-right shunting. The answer is E) Increased left-to-right shunting.",E,False
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?","{'A': 'Acts as an important opsonin  ', 'B': 'Plays a role in angioedema', 'C': 'Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor', 'D': 'Creates pores in the cell membrane', 'E': 'Induces the alternative complement pathway'}",D,"The patient's history of recurrent infections, specifically with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, suggests a defect in the complement system, which is a part of the innate immune system. The complement system can be activated through several pathways, one of which is the classical pathway that is initiated by antibodies bound to the pathogen. A deficiency in any of the components of the complement system can lead to recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria.

Option A states that the component acts as an important opsonin. Opsonins are molecules that mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytes. Complement components such as C3b and C4b are known to be important opsonins.

Option B refers to a role in angioedema. This is not directly related to the complement system or to recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria.

Option C mentions degradation by C1 esterase inhibitor. This is related to hereditary angioedema and not to recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria.

Option D talks about creating pores in the cell membrane. This is more related to the action of certain antibiotics or to the function of certain toxins and not to the complement system.

Option E refers to inducing the alternative complement pathway. The alternative complement pathway is one of the ways to activate the complement system, but it is not typically associated with recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria.

Given the patient's history of recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria and the role of complement in opsonization, the most likely deficient component in this patient is one that acts as an important opsonin.

Therefore, the answer is A) Acts as an important opsonin.",A,False
"A 55-year-old man presents into the emergency department with a severe cough and difficulty breathing. He says that he finds himself out of breath after taking a few steps, and has to sit down and rest, in order to continue. He also says that, at night, he has the greatest difficulty in breathing and usually uses at least 3 pillows to sleep comfortably. He mentions a cough that appears only at night, but which is persistent enough to wake him up from sleep. He mentions that he has had a ‘heart attack’ 5 years ago. He also says that he continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis even though his doctor has advised against it.

His history of a previous heart attack also supports this diagnosis. The next step in management would be to assess the cardiac function and structure. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that can provide information about the heart's pumping function and the presence of any structural abnormalities. Therefore, the answer is C) Echocardiogram.",C,True
"A 61-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her last Pap smear 3 years ago showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. HPV testing was negative at that time. On questioning, she has had fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","{'A': 'Proliferation of endometrial glands', 'B': 'Elevated serum CA-125 level', 'C': 'Elevated serum beta-hCG level', 'D': 'Prolonged prothrombin time', 'E': 'Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear'}",B,"The patient is a 61-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance on her last Pap smear, which was 3 years ago. She has had fatigue, weight loss, and an increase in abdominal girth. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. On examination, there is shifting dullness on abdominal examination, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and a right adnexal mass on bimanual palpation. These findings suggest the possibility of an ovarian mass, which could be either benign or malignant.

Option A (Proliferation of endometrial glands) is more suggestive of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, which is less likely given the examination findings.

Option B (Elevated serum CA-125 level) is a tumor marker that is often elevated in ovarian cancer, which could be consistent with the patient's presentation and physical examination findings.

Option C (Elevated serum beta-hCG level) is associated with pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic disease, which is unlikely in this case given the patient's age, nulliparous status, and clinical presentation.

Option D (Prolonged prothrombin time) is associated with coagulopathies or liver disease, which does not fit well with the current clinical picture.

Option E (Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear) is a finding that could be associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, but the patient's HPV testing was negative, and this finding does not explain the adnexal mass or other symptoms.

Based on the information provided, the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient would be an elevated serum CA-125 level, which is associated with ovarian cancer. Therefore, the answer is B) Elevated serum CA-125 level.",A,False

He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Na+ 138 mEq/L
K+ 4.2 mEq/L

He has a history of recent total thyroidectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. His mother's history of lung cancer and his smoking history are less immediately relevant to the acute presentation. His vital signs are relatively stable, and his physical examination is unremarkable except for the nurse's observation of hand spasm during blood pressure measurement.

The laboratory results show a normal serum calcium level of 10.4 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL) and a normal phosphorus level of 4.3 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL). However, his parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is elevated at 115 pg/mL (normal range: 10-65 pg/mL). The elevated PTH in the context of normal calcium levels suggests a state of hyperparathyroidism, which could be due to inadvertent removal or damage to the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy. This can lead to hypocalcemia, which may cause symptoms such as muscle cramping and numbness.

Given the patient's symptoms and the elevated PTH level, the most appropriate initial step in management would be to address the potential hypocalcemia. Administering calcium gluconate would help to correct the hypocalcemia and alleviate the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is D) Administer calcium gluconate.",D,True
"A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient’s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient’s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient’s mother is 5’7”, and the patient’s father is 5’10”. The patient’s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient’s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?","{'A': 'Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear', 'B': 'Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level', 'C': 'Elevated serum TSH level', 'D': 'Low serum ACTH level', 'E': 'Mass in the sella turcica'}",A,"The patient is a 5-year-old female with a history of moderate persistent asthma, myopia, and a growth pattern consistent with her genetic potential. She has a low hairline and a broad chest, which are physical exam findings that may suggest a genetic syndrome. The patient also has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair, indicating the onset of puberty.

Given the patient's physical exam findings and the presence of a broad chest and low hairline, one might consider a diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). BWS is characterized by overgrowth and an increased risk of developing certain cancers. One of the features of BWS is the presence of macroglossia (enlarged tongue), which can lead to difficulties with feeding and speech.

Option A (Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear) would suggest a chromosomal abnormality such as Turner syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Option B (Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level) is often seen in conditions associated with bone turnover or liver disease, which does not fit the clinical picture described.

Option C (Elevated serum TSH level) would suggest hypothyroidism, which is not indicated by the patient's presentation and would not explain the physical findings.

Option D (Low serum ACTH level) would be more consistent with an adrenal insufficiency, which does not align with the patient's history of requiring steroids for asthma exacerbations.

Option E (Mass in the sella turcica) would suggest a pituitary tumor, which could potentially cause precocious puberty. However, given the patient's broad chest and low hairline, a genetic syndrome such as BWS seems more likely.

Therefore, the answer is E) Mass in the sella turcica.",A,True

On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?","{'A': 'Gangrenous necrosis', 'B': 'Liquefactive necrosis', 'C': 'Caseous necrosis', 'D': 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'E': 'Coagulative necrosis'}",B,"The patient's clinical presentation suggests an acute neurological event, likely a stroke. The presence of hypertonic reflexes and a positive Babinski reflex indicates an upper motor neuron lesion. Given the patient's history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, a cerebral infarction is highly likely. The CT scan would help confirm the diagnosis, but since it is not provided, we can deduce that the pathologic change is likely related to ischemia.

The most common type of cell death associated with ischemic events, such as strokes, is liquefactive necrosis. This type of necrosis occurs in the brain due to the high fat content and the action of hydrolytic enzymes that turn the tissue into a liquid viscous mass.

Therefore, the answer is B) Liquefactive necrosis.",B,True
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Vital signs are within normal limits.

This patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with a virus with which of the following features?","{'A': 'Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded DNA', 'B': 'Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA', 'C': 'Enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA', 'D': 'Enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA', 'E': 'Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA'}",E,"The clinical presentation of dysuria and increased urinary frequency in a 6-year-old boy, along with cloudy, red urine, is suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs in children are most commonly caused by bacteria, not viruses. Therefore, the question is asking about a virus with features that could cause similar symptoms, although this is not typical for a viral infection.

Among the options provided, the only virus that is known to cause UTI-like symptoms is the Adenovirus. Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus with linear, double-stranded DNA. Therefore, the answer is E) Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA.",E,True
"A 49-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and cough which she developed approx. 8 hours ago. 2 weeks ago she had a prophylactic ovariectomy because of a family history of ovarian cancer. She is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 hypertension, but she does not take her antihypertensives because she is not concerned about her blood pressure. Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/80 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 31/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is 89%. On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:
pH 7.49
PaO2 58 mm Hg
PaCO2 30 mm Hg
HCO3-  22 mEq/L
Based on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?","{'A': 'Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli', 'B': 'Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons', 'C': 'Alveolar fibrosis', 'D': 'Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation', 'E': 'Decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction'}",A,"The patient presents with progressive dyspnea, cough, fever, and acrocyanosis, which are signs of respiratory distress. The arterial blood gases analysis shows a pH of 7.49 (indicating respiratory acidosis), PaO2 of 58 mm Hg (hypoxemia), PaCO2 of 30 mm Hg (hyperventilation), and HCO3- of 22 mEq/L (normal). The presence of S3 and accentuated S2 best heard at the left sternal border suggests the possibility of heart failure. However, the absence of leg edema and the patient's history of opioid abuse point towards opioid-induced respiratory depression as the most likely cause of respiratory failure. Opioids can depress the respiratory center by activating μ-receptors in the brainstem. Therefore, the answer is D) Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation.",D,False
"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?","{'A': 'Lymphocytes', 'B': 'Immunoglobulin class switching', 'C': 'Superoxide dismutase', 'D': 'Myeloperoxidase', 'E': 'Respiratory burst'}",E,"The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to diagnose chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is a defect in the oxidative burst pathway of phagocytes. In CGD, phagocytes like neutrophils cannot produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex. This leads to an inability to kill certain bacteria and fungi. The options given are:

A. Lymphocytes - Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell involved in the adaptive immune response, not directly related to the NBT test.
B. Immunoglobulin class switching - This is a process in B cells where they change the type of antibody they produce. It is not related to the NBT test.
C. Superoxide dismutase - This is an enzyme that converts superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide. It is not the cause of the dysfunction in the NBT test.
D. Myeloperoxidase - This is an enzyme present in neutrophils that uses hydrogen peroxide to produce hypochlorous acid, which is toxic to pathogens. It is not the cause of the dysfunction in the NBT test.
E. Respiratory burst - This is the rapid release of ROS by phagocytes during pathogen destruction. A defect in the respiratory burst is what causes a positive NBT test, indicating CGD.

Therefore, the answer is E) Respiratory burst.",E,True
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency room with unilateral leg swelling. She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Elevated serum homocysteine', 'B': 'Thrombin inhibitor deficiency', 'C': 'Deficiency in protein C', 'D': 'Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids', 'E': 'Resistance to clotting factor degradation'}",E,"The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and now presents with symptoms consistent with another DVT, which has been confirmed by ultrasound. Given the recurrent nature of her DVTs and the fact that she has an inherited condition, we should consider a hereditary thrombophilia. The most common hereditary thrombophilias include:

A. Elevated serum homocysteine: This can be seen in homocystinuria or due to deficiencies of B vitamins (B6, B9, B12). It is a risk factor for thrombosis but is not the most common hereditary cause.

B. Thrombin inhibitor deficiency: This refers to deficiency of protein C or protein S, which are important in the anticoagulant pathway. Deficiency of protein C is the most common hereditary thrombophilia.

C. Deficiency in protein C: As mentioned above, this is a common cause of hereditary thrombophilia.

D. Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids: This refers to antiphospholipid syndrome, which is an acquired condition rather than a hereditary one.

E. Resistance to clotting factor degradation: This is seen in conditions like hemophilia, which is not a thrombophilic condition but rather a bleeding disorder.

Given the information that the patient has an inherited condition and the recurrent nature of her DVTs, the most likely pathophysiology is a deficiency in a thrombin inhibitor, specifically protein C, which is option B. Therefore, the answer is B) Thrombin inhibitor deficiency.",B,False

Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?""","{'A': 'Acute hepatitis A', 'B': 'Choledocholithiasis', 'C': 'Autoimmune hepatitis', 'D': 'Cholecystitis', 'E': 'Pancreatitis\n""'}",B,"The patient is experiencing episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant with nausea and vomiting. The pain is episodic, and the patient is asymptomatic between episodes. She has a history of resection of the terminal ileum due to Crohn's disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On examination, there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound, and mild scleral icterus is noted. Laboratory studies show elevated total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT levels. Abdominal ultrasonography reveals a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm), and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.

Based on these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is choledocholithiasis (B), which is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct. The normal gallbladder wall and absence of pericholecystic fluid make acute cholecystitis (D) less likely. The absence of wall thickening also makes pancreatitis (E) less likely. The normal liver and lack of wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid make cholecystitis (D) and pancreatitis (E) less likely. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and bilirubin suggest biliary obstruction, which is consistent with choledocholithiasis (B). Acute hepatitis A (A) and autoimmune hepatitis (C) are less likely given the ultrasound findings and the episodic nature of the pain.

Therefore, the answer is B) Choledocholithiasis.",B,True

"A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?","{'A': 'Furosemide', 'B': 'Nesiritide', 'C': 'Metoprolol', 'D': 'Digoxin', 'E': 'Dobutamine'}",C,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The presence of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability are indicative of heart failure. The low blood pressure (80/50 mm Hg), prominent neck vein distention, an S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema further support this diagnosis. The 2D echo showing a decreased ejection fraction (32%) confirms the presence of systolic dysfunction.

In the management of HFrEF, certain medications are commonly used:

A) Furosemide is a loop diuretic that helps reduce fluid overload by increasing urine output, thereby relieving symptoms of congestion such as edema and pulmonary congestion.

B) Nesiritide is a recombinant form of B-type natriuretic peptide that can be used in acute decompensated heart failure to reduce preload and afterload, but it is not typically used as a long-term management medication.

C) Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that has been shown to improve survival in patients with HFrEF by reducing heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand.

D) Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that can improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations in HFrEF but does not improve survival. It can also help control heart rate in atrial fibrillation, which is common in heart failure patients.

E) Dobutamine is an inotropic agent that increases myocardial contractility and is used in acute settings where there is evidence of low cardiac output with hypotension and signs of shock.

Given the patient's presentation with hypotension (80/50 mm Hg), a medication that could potentially worsen the hypotension should be avoided. Among the options provided, dobutamine (E) is the most likely to cause a further decrease in blood pressure due to its positive inotropic effect, which can increase myocardial oxygen demand and potentially lead to worsening hypotension.

Therefore, the answer is E) Dobutamine.",E,False

Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","{'A': 'CT scan of the abdomen', 'B': 'Laparoscopy', 'C': 'Laparotomy', 'D': 'MRI of the pelvis', 'E': 'Observation and serial abdominal exams'}",B,"The patient is a 25-year-old woman who presents with sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature and tachycardia with a pulse of 120/min. The physical exam reveals a left adnexal mass and tenderness, but no abdominal tenderness. The transvaginal ultrasound shows free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow, which suggests an ovarian torsion. The urinary pregnancy test is negative, ruling out pregnancy-related causes of the adnexal mass. The patient's symptoms persisted despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen.

Given the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings, the most likely diagnosis is ovarian torsion. The best next step in management for ovarian torsion is surgical intervention to untwist the ovary and potentially resect the necrotic ovarian tissue if viability is compromised.

GAD is often accompanied by physical symptoms such as restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

The treatment for GAD typically involves the use of medications such as benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the options provided, Diazepam (A) and Alprazolam (E) are benzodiazepines, which can be effective for acute anxiety relief but are not ideal for long-term management due to the risk of tolerance, dependence, and potential side effects. Zolpidem (B) and Ramelteon (C) are primarily used for sleep disturbances and would not address the patient's daytime anxiety symptoms.

Buspirone (D) is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is specifically indicated for the treatment of GAD. It has a lower risk of dependence and abuse compared to benzodiazepines and is often used for chronic anxiety management. Therefore, the most appropriate option for this patient's symptoms would be Buspirone.

One week after starting a new medication, her blood counts have slightly improved but remain abnormal (hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and platelet count of 56,000/mm3).

Let's evaluate the drugs:

A. Aldesleukin is an interleukin-2 analog used to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma. It can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

B. Interferon beta is used for multiple sclerosis and chronic hepatitis B. It is not commonly associated with significant bone marrow suppression.

C. Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor used to treat neutropenia. It stimulates the production of neutrophils and would not be expected to cause leukopenia.

D. Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist used to treat thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It would not be expected to cause thrombocytopenia.

E. Sargramostim is a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor used to treat severe congenital neutropenia and to stimulate bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. It can cause bone marrow stimulation but can also suppress the bone marrow, leading to cytopenias.

She has been sexually active with multiple male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently; she has been taking an oral contraceptive for the past 2 years. She has no previous history of serious illness or sexually transmitted diseases. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 5.8. Bimanual examination is unremarkable. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?","{'A': 'Obligate intracellular organisms', 'B': 'Gram-negative diplococci', 'C': 'Positive whiff test', 'D': 'Pseudohyphae', 'E': 'Flagellated protozoa'}",E,"The patient presents with symptoms of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination. She also has a history of recent antibiotic use, multiple sexual partners, and inconsistent condom use. The pelvic examination reveals erythema of the vulva and vagina with a foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green discharge. The pH of the discharge is 5.8, which is higher than the normal vaginal pH of 3.8 to 4.5. These findings are suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.

Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina, leading to the replacement of normal lactobacilli. The presence of a fishy odor, often described as a ""whiff"" smell, is a classic sign of bacterial vaginosis. This can be confirmed by performing a whiff test, where the smell of the vaginal discharge becomes more pronounced after the addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH).

The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation and findings:

A. Obligate intracellular organisms are characteristic of infections like chlamydia, which would not typically cause a frothy discharge.
B. Gram-negative diplococci are indicative of gonorrhea, which usually presents with purulent discharge rather than a frothy one.
D. Pseudohyphae are associated with candidiasis (yeast infection), which typically presents with a thick, white discharge and is not usually frothy or foul-smelling.
E. Flagellated protozoa are indicative of trichomoniasis, which can cause a frothy, yellow-green discharge but is less likely in this case given the elevated pH and the absence of other typical symptoms such as strawberry cervix.

Therefore, the answer is C) Positive whiff test.",C,False

The presence of a high chloride (Cl-) level of 115 mEq/L in the serum and a urine pH of 7.0 further supports the diagnosis of AKI, as the kidneys are unable to excrete acid (in the form of hydrogen ions) and thus acid accumulates in the blood and urine.

Among the listed drugs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is known to cause AKI by inhibiting the renal tubular secretion of uric acid, which can lead to the development of acidosis. This drug is an antibiotic commonly used to treat urinary tract infections.

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that causes metabolic acidosis but does not typically cause AKI.

Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) but is not typically associated with AKI.

Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication that can cause nephrotoxicity, but it is not the most likely cause of AKI with metabolic acidosis in this scenario.

Heparin is an anticoagulant that does not typically cause AKI or metabolic acidosis.

Therefore, the answer is A) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",A,False

"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?","{'A': 'Immobilization', 'B': 'Moderate flexion then hyperpronation', 'C': 'Open reduction', 'D': 'Radiograph', 'E': 'Supination then maximal extension'}",B,"The patient's history and clinical presentation are suggestive of a nursemaid's elbow, which is a common injury in young children resulting from a sudden pull on an extended and pronated arm. The ""click"" heard by the father and the immediate onset of crying are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's refusal to use the affected limb and pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow further support this. The fact that the patient allows passive flexion and extension with a full range of motion but has limited supination and experiences pain during this maneuver confirms the diagnosis of a nursemaid's elbow.

The next step in management for a nursemaid's elbow is to perform a specific maneuver to release the trapped elbow flexor tendons. This maneuver involves supination of the forearm followed by maximal extension of the elbow. This action often results in a palpable ""click"" as the trapped tendons are released and the elbow is reduced.

Therefore, the correct answer is E) Supination then maximal extension.",E,False
"A 68-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a 7-month history of fatigue and low back pain. Her pain is not improved by over the counter analgesics.

C. Schistocytes",C,False
An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,"{'A': 'Chorionic gonadotropin therapy', 'B': 'Exploratory laparoscopy', 'C': 'Follow-up examination in 6 months', 'D': 'Orchiectomy', 'E': 'Orchiopexy'}",E,"The 11-month-old boy in the question has a poorly rugated scrotum and only one testicle palpated in the scrotum, while the other is found in the inguinal canal. This clinical presentation is consistent with an undescended testicle, also known as cryptorchidism. The normal urethral meatus and the absence of other abnormalities suggest that there is no urinary tract problem.

The management of an undescended testicle depends on the age of the child and the position of the testicle. In infants, the testicle may descend spontaneously by 6 months of age. However, if the testicle remains undescended beyond 6 months, intervention is usually required.

The options provided are:

A. Chorionic gonadotropin therapy: This is a hormonal treatment that may be used to stimulate testicular descent. However, it is not the first-line treatment for undescended testicles.

B. Exploratory laparoscopy: This is a surgical procedure that allows the physician to locate the position of the undescended testicle. It is usually performed if the testicle cannot be palpated or if there is suspicion of an abdominal testis.

C. Follow-up examination in 6 months: This option would be appropriate if there was a possibility of spontaneous descent. However, since the child is already 11 months old and the testicle has not descended by 6 months, further intervention is likely needed.

D. Orchiectomy: This is the surgical removal of the undescended testicle. It is not the first-line treatment for undescended testicles, especially in a child who has not yet reached the age of 1 year.

E. Orchiopexy: This is a surgical procedure to move the undescended testicle into the scrotum and secure it there. It is the definitive treatment for an undescended testicle that does not descend spontaneously by 6 months of age.

Given that the child is 11 months old and the testicle has not descended spontaneously, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an orchiopexy to move the testicle into the scrotum and secure it there. Therefore, the answer is E)",E,True

The most appropriate next step in management would be to secure the airway and provide ventilatory support. Intubation with mechanical ventilation is the best option to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation in a patient who is unable to maintain these parameters on their own.

Therefore, the answer is A) Intubate with mechanical ventilation.",A,True
"A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction.

Despite regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, a corticosteroid, he has developed nocturnal cough and mild wheezing. This suggests that there has been a change in his asthma status. The options given are all related to changes that can occur in asthma.

A) Airway epithelial shedding is not typically associated with loss of asthma control.
B) Airway smooth muscle atrophy is not a common feature of asthma and is not associated with loss of asthma control.
C) Airway remodeling is a process that occurs in chronic asthma and can lead to a loss of response to medications and a decline in lung function.
D) Airway inflammation is a hallmark of asthma and is always present in asthma exacerbations.
E) Airway hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic feature of asthma, but it does not change over time in the context of asthma control.

Given these options, the most likely reason for the recent loss of asthma control in this patient is airway remodeling, which can lead to a partial irreversible airway obstruction as suggested by the spirometry reports. Therefore, the answer is C) Airway remodeling.",C,True

Among the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis (D) or dermatomyositis (E). However, since the patient denies any headaches or change in vision, dermatomyositis (E) is less likely as it typically presents with characteristic skin rash and may involve other systems. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis (D), which is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and inflammation without skin involvement.",C,False

"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain (10/10 in severity), radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm. His symptoms started 20 minutes ago while shaving. He also feels nauseated, lightheaded and short of breath. He has had type 2 diabetes for 27 years and essential hypertension for 19 years. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. Family history is irrelevant. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg and the pulse is 107/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. ECG is shown in the image. Troponins are elevated. The patient is admitted to a unit with continuous cardiac monitoring. Aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine are given immediately and the patient now rates the pain as 4–5 out of 10. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?","{'A': 'Percutaneous coronary intervention', 'B': 'Intravenous alteplase', 'C': 'Coronary artery bypass graft', 'D': 'Oral ramipril', 'E': 'Oral eplerenone'}",A,"The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), including crushing chest pain radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm, associated with nausea, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. His risk factors include long-standing type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension, and a significant smoking history. The ECG findings and elevated troponins further support the diagnosis of AMI.

Given that the patient has been admitted to a unit with continuous cardiac monitoring and has already received aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine, the next step in management should focus on reperfusion therapy. The two main options for reperfusion are percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombolytic therapy.

PCI (Option A) is the preferred treatment for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) if it can be performed in a timely manner (ideally within 90 minutes of first medical contact). Thrombolytic therapy (Option B), such as intravenous alteplase, is an alternative when PCI is not available within the recommended time frame.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (Option C) is not the immediate treatment for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. It may be considered in certain cases of complex coronary artery disease or if the patient has failed medical therapy and is a candidate for surgery.

Oral ramipril (Option D) and oral eplerenone (Option E) are medications used for chronic management of heart failure and to reduce the risk of death after a heart attack, respectively. They are not the immediate next steps in the acute management of a patient presenting with AMI.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient's condition, assuming the hospital has the capability to perform it in a timely manner, would be percutaneous coronary intervention. Therefore, the answer is A) Percutaneous coronary intervention.",A,True

"A 75-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of nausea and vomiting. Over the past 2 days, he has also been feeling weak and tired. When standing up after sitting for a while, he feels dizzy. He says he has to go to the bathroom more often than usual, and that he is urinating “a normal amount” each time. He has not had diarrhea. He has hypertension, for which he has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He drinks 9 glasses of water per day and takes his medication regularly. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure is 106/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min.

His symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness upon standing are consistent with dehydration. The whitening of the tongue and skin that retracts slowly when pinched are signs of dehydration as well. The laboratory studies show hypernatremia (high serum sodium), hyperchloremia (high serum chloride), and an elevated serum osmolality, which are all consistent with dehydration. The high hemoglobin A1C indicates poor glycemic control, which is a risk factor for diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Diabetes insipidus would lead to the production of a large volume of dilute urine, as indicated by the urine osmolality of 400 mOsm/kg, despite the high serum osmolality. This is not consistent with diuretic overdose (A), which would typically present with hypokalemia and a low urine osmolality. Osmotic diuresis (B) would not be expected in the absence of hyperglycemia or other osmotically active substances in the urine. Excess production of aldosterone (D) would lead to hypernatremia and hypokalemia, but would not explain the high urine osmolality. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (E).",A,False

"A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?","{'A': 'Gram stain positive CSF', 'B': 'Peripheral eosinophilia', 'C': 'Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis', 'D': 'Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count', 'E': 'Oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid analysis'}",D,"The patient presents with symptoms of gastroenteritis, including vomiting, loose stools, and bloody stools. The presence of bloody stools (guaiac positive) and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes) suggest a significant loss of fluids and possibly electrolytes. The initiation of acetaminophen and fluid resuscitation is appropriate for management.

However, the next day, the patient develops lower extremity weakness and tingling, with decreased patellar deep tendon reflexes. These neurological symptoms are concerning for a complication of the gastroenteritis, which could be related to electrolyte imbalances. Given the symptoms and the recent fluid loss, the most likely electrolyte disturbance would be hyponatremia, which can cause neurological symptoms due to the shift of fluid in and out of neurons.

Option D describes increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count, which can be seen in conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is a post-infectious immune-mediated polyneuropathy that can occur after gastroenteritis. It is characterized by ascending weakness and areflexia. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with GBS, which would explain the neurological symptoms following an episode of gastroenteritis.

Therefore, the answer is D) Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count.",D,True
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1).

He has a history of asthma and his mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite initial improvement, he had another episode of decreased consciousness overnight, during which his serum glucose was low (19 mg/dL), but his insulin and C-peptide levels were inappropriately elevated (insulin 108 mIU/L and C-peptide 0.3 ng/mL).

The elevated insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemia suggest that the boy is producing an excess amount of insulin. This is not consistent with malingering (A) or conversion disorder (D), as these conditions would not explain the abnormal laboratory findings. Glucagonoma (B) is associated with hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. Primary adrenal insufficiency (C) can cause hypoglycemia, but it is not associated with elevated insulin and C-peptide levels.

Factitious disorder imposed on another (E) is a condition in which a person deliberately causes or induces symptoms in another person. In this case, the boy's mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is possible that she administered insulin to her son, leading to the hypoglycemic episodes. The elevated insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemia are consistent with exogenous insulin administration, as C-peptide is released when the body's own insulin is produced.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another (E).",D,False

She has had a healthy pregnancy with no complications, follows medical advice well, and has a history of a normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are normal, and her cervical examination shows that she is fully effaced and fully dilated, indicating that she is ready for delivery. The cardiotocograph, which is mentioned but not shown, likely indicates normal fetal heart rate patterns.

Given this information, the most appropriate initial step in management would be to provide reassurance (Option C) to the patient and allow for the progression of labor without any medical intervention. The patient is at full term, in active labor, with no signs of complications, and her cervix is fully effaced and dilated, suggesting that she is in the second stage of labor.

Options A (Amnioinfusion), B (Induced vaginal delivery), D (Repositioning), and E (Urgent cesarean delivery) are not indicated based on the information provided. Amnioinfusion is used in cases of oxytocin augmentation or induction of labor with a low amniotic fluid level, which is not mentioned here. Induced vaginal delivery is typically considered when labor is not progressing, which is not the case as the patient is fully dilated and in active labor. Repositioning is usually done for fetal distress or maternal comfort, neither of which is indicated. Urgent cesarean delivery is reserved for situations where there is fetal distress, maternal distress, or failure to progress in labor, none of which are present in this scenario.

The fact that she avoids eating due to these episodes and has experienced weight loss further supports this diagnosis. Smoking and the use of over the counter painkillers for chronic knee pain are risk factors for peptic ulcer disease. The absence of fever and an unremarkable abdominal exam make an acute inflammatory process less likely.

Between the options of duodenal peptic ulcer (A) and gastric peptic ulcer (D), the location of the pain is not clearly specified. However, since the pain is described as epigastric, it could be more consistent with a duodenal peptic ulcer, which typically presents with epigastric pain.

Choledocholithiasis (B) and pancreatitis (C) are less likely because the patient does not have right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, or elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are common in these conditions. Gallbladder cancer (E) is also less likely given the absence of jaundice, weight loss, and the fact that the abdominal exam is unremarkable.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is A) Duodenal peptic ulcer.",B,False

The elevated bilirubin suggests that the jaundice is predominantly caused by direct hyperbilirubinemia. This can be due to various causes such as hemolysis, impaired bilirubin excretion, or liver damage.

Option A, ""A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir,"" is not relevant without additional context. Sofosbuvir is a medication used to treat hepatitis C, which is not indicated here without evidence of hepatitis C infection.

Option B, ""Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity,"" is associated with Gilbert's syndrome, which is a benign condition characterized by intermittent episodes of mild jaundice due to reduced activity of the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin. However, the patient's bilirubin levels are quite high, which is not typical for Gilbert's syndrome.

Option C, ""Hyperpigmentation of the liver,"" is not directly related to the patient's presentation of jaundice. Hyperpigmentation of the liver can occur in conditions like hemochromatosis but does not explain the jaundice.

Option D, ""Increased consumption of beta-carotene,"" can lead to a yellowish discoloration of the skin, but it would not cause the elevated bilirubin levels seen in this patient.

Option E, ""Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT,"" is often seen in alcoholic liver disease. However, the patient's liver enzymes are not elevated in this scenario.

Given the patient's history of IV drug use, there is a possibility of viral hepatitis, which can cause jaundice. However, none of the options provided directly relate to this possibility. Without additional information, the most appropriate option related to the underlying pathology causing jaundice in this patient is decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity, which is associated with conditions like Gilbert's syndrome or more",A,False

Importantly, her anti-D antibody screen is negative, indicating that she has not yet developed antibodies against Rh(D) positive blood.

In cases where a pregnant woman is Rh-negative and at risk of being exposed to Rh(D) positive blood (e.g., from a previous transfusion), it is standard practice to administer anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent the development of antibodies that could affect future pregnancies. This is typically done at 28 weeks gestation and within 72 hours after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.

Given this information, the best next step in managing this patient would be to:

Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.

Therefore, the answer is B) Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.",B,True
"A 61-year-old man complaining of unexplained bleeding by from the mouth is escorted to the emergency department by corrections officers. Upon examination patient states he feels nauseated as he begins to retch violently and vomit bright red blood. His past medical history is remarkable for cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and untreated hepatitis C. His current blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 128/min, and oxygen saturation in room air is 88%. On further questioning, he states that he is scared to die and wants everything done to save his life. IV fluids are initiated and packed RBCs are ordered. You begin to review his labs and notice and he has elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate. What would be the appropriate response to the patient?","{'A': 'Consult an ethics committee to determine whether to resuscitate the patient', 'B': 'Do not intubate the patient since he does not have written request to be resuscitated', 'C': ""Accept the patient's wishes and appoint and get a psych evaluation."", 'D': ""Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care."", 'E': 'Obtain an emergency order from a judge to initiate resuscitation.'}",D,"The patient is presenting with signs of an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely secondary to his history of cirrhosis. His hemodynamic instability, as evidenced by hypotension and tachycardia, along with hypoxia, suggests that he is in need of immediate resuscitation. The elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate indicates that he is likely in a state of metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with his presentation. The elevated ammonia is also consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which can be seen in the setting of cirrhosis. The elevated lactate is likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion due to the bleeding and shock state.

Given the patient's current state and his expressed wishes to do everything to save his life, it would be appropriate to provide aggressive resuscitation, including intubation if necessary for airway protection and to manage his bleeding and coagulopathy.

Therefore, the answer is D) Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.",D,True
"A 56-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of fatigue and painless bruising over her arms and trunk. She has also had several episodes of nosebleeds that resolved with compression after a few minutes. She recently completed treatment for a urinary tract infection. She has had no changes in her weight. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her last menstrual cycle was 5 years ago. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Home medications include metformin, amlodipine, and enalapril. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. There are ecchymoses and petechiae over the upper extremities, chest, and back. There is no lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:

Total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL
LDH 80 U/L
Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""","{'A': 'Serum transferrin level', 'B': 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'C': 'Flow cytometry', 'D': 'Peripheral blood smear', 'E': 'Serum porphobilinogen level'}",B,"The patient presents with fatigue, painless bruising, and nosebleeds, which are signs of a possible hematologic disorder. The laboratory findings of anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low leukocyte count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) with a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) suggest a pancytopenia without an apparent cause such as infection or bleeding. The reticulocyte count is low, indicating that the bone marrow is not responding adequately to the anemia.

The differential diagnosis for pancytopenia includes bone marrow failure (e.g., aplastic anemia), infiltrative diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes, and hematologic malignancies. To confirm the diagnosis, a definitive test that evaluates the cellular components of the bone marrow is required.

Option A (Serum transferrin level) would be useful in evaluating iron status but does not directly confirm the diagnosis of a hematologic disorder.
Option B (Bone marrow biopsy) is the gold standard for evaluating the cellular components of the bone marrow and can confirm a diagnosis of bone marrow failure or infiltrative diseases.
Option C (Flow cytometry) is used to identify specific cell surface markers and can be helpful in diagnosing hematologic malignancies.
Option D (Peripheral blood smear) can provide clues to the diagnosis but is not definitive for bone marrow disorders.
Option E (Serum porphobilinogen level) is used in the diagnosis of porphyrias, which do not present with pancytopenia.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a bone marrow biopsy would be most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis by directly assessing the cellular components of the bone marrow.

Therefore, the answer is B) Bone marrow biopsy.",A,False
"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering.

These symptoms are suggestive of a serotonergic syndrome, which can occur due to excessive accumulation of serotonin in the central nervous system. This can be precipitated by medications that increase serotonin levels. The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking citalopram, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). She previously took paroxetine, another SSRI, but switched due to lack of efficacy. SSRIs can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with other serotonergic agents. The patient also takes ibuprofen for headaches and recently started an amino acid supplement. Some amino acid supplements, such as tryptophan, can also increase serotonin levels. However, the most likely inciting factor in this case is the medication change (Option C), as SSRIs are well-known to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic agents or even with certain foods and supplements.

"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?","{'A': 'Headache and tinnitus', 'B': 'Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits', 'C': 'Dyslipidemia and hypoglycemia unawareness', 'D': 'Pedal edema and flushing', 'E': 'Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity'}",A,"The patient has been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, which is characterized by ST-segment elevations and incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) on an electrocardiogram (ECG). He has been prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. It also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration but does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. Additionally, it has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.

Class I anti-arrhythmic drugs include quinidine, procainamide, and sotalol. Out of these options, quinidine is known to have anticholinergic side effects, which can lead to symptoms such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and blurred vision. It also has alpha-blocking activity, which can cause vasodilation and lead to hypotension.

Considering the side effects of class I anti-arrhythmic drugs, especially quinidine, the most likely side effects if taken in high doses would be related to its anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activities. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Pedal edema and flushing.",B,False

A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after a temporal artery biopsy was performed to evaluate headache and blurry vision. He has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Results of the testing show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?,"{'A': 'Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin', 'B': 'Increased phosphorylation of myosin', 'C': 'Increased production of nitric oxide', 'D': 'Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate', 'E': 'Decreased concentration of bradykinin'}",C,"The question is asking for the most likely explanation for decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells in a patient with a history of hypertension. Arginine is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), which is an important vasodilator. NO is produced from arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS).

Option A (Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin) and option B (Increased phosphorylation of myosin) are related to smooth muscle contraction and do not directly explain decreased arginine levels.

Option D (Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate) is incorrect because cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a second messenger that is downstream of nitric oxide and does not directly affect arginine levels.

Option E (Decreased concentration of bradykinin) is also incorrect because bradykinin is an independent vasodilator that does not rely on arginine for its production.

Option C (Increased production of nitric oxide) is the most likely explanation for decreased concentrations of arginine. If there is increased production of nitric oxide, it would imply that the arginine is being used up more quickly than it is being replenished, leading to decreased concentrations of arginine.

Therefore, the answer is C) Increased production of nitric oxide.",A,False
"A 54-year-old woman presents with fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath over the past 5 months. Past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 23 years ago for which she takes naproxen as needed. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure 135/88 mm Hg, pulse 92/min. Physical examination is significant for conjunctival pallor and bilateral ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

The laboratory findings support this diagnosis and provide additional information about the type of anemia. The hemoglobin level is low at 9.2 g/dL, indicating anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 76 fL, which is below the normal range (80-100 fL), suggesting that the anemia is microcytic. The leukocyte and platelet counts are within normal limits. The serum ferritin level is elevated at 310 ng/mL, which is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia but rather suggests anemia of chronic disease (ACD). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is also elevated at 85 mm/h, which is consistent with a chronic inflammatory process, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Given these findings, the most appropriate option is:

D. Upregulation of hepcidin

Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron homeostasis and is often increased in the setting of chronic inflammation, leading to iron sequestration and decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. This is consistent with anemia of chronic disease.",C,False

Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?","{'A': 'High T4 and T3', 'B': 'Low T4 and T3', 'C': 'High TSH', 'D': 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'E': 'Low TSH'}",C,"The patient's symptoms of weight gain, decreased exercise tolerance, slowed thinking, and thickened, dry skin are suggestive of hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This leads to a decrease in serum levels of T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine), which are the main thyroid hormones. The most direct measure of thyroid function is the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce T4 and T3. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are typically elevated as the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the underactive thyroid gland to produce more hormones. Therefore, the most helpful finding in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism would be a low level of T4 and T3, confirming the deficiency of thyroid hormones, along with an elevated TSH, indicating the body's attempt to compensate for the deficiency. The answer is B) Low T4 and T3.",B,False

"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days.

On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?","{'A': 'Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes', 'B': 'Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase', 'C': 'Decreased proteolysis', 'D': 'Increased lipoprotein lipase activity', 'E': 'Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells'}",A,"The patient presents with symptoms of confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting, frequent urination, excessive water intake, weight loss, and labored breathing. The vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia. The physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness with guarding. The laboratory tests show a low pH indicating acidosis and a very high blood glucose level. These clinical findings are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes mellitus. In DKA, there is a deficiency of insulin leading to decreased glucose uptake by cells. The hormone referred to in the question is insulin.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes: In the absence of insulin, glucose uptake by adipocytes is indeed decreased. However, this is not the most characteristic feature of the complication described.

B) Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase: This is incorrect because in the absence of insulin, hormone sensitive lipase activity is actually increased, leading to the mobilization of fatty acids from adipocytes.

C) Decreased proteolysis: This is not correct. In the absence of insulin, proteolysis is increased as part of the catabolic state.

D) Increased lipoprotein lipase activity: This is incorrect because in the absence of insulin, lipoprotein lipase activity is decreased, which contributes to hypertriglyceridemia.

E) Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells: This is not correct. The brain can utilize glucose without the need for insulin. However, in the context of DKA, the brain is not spared from the effects of hyperglycemia and can be affected by it.

The most characteristic feature of the complication described, considering the decreased levels of insulin, would be decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes, as adipocytes require insulin to take up glucose. Therefore, the answer is A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.",A,True

One of the classic findings on urinalysis in nephrotic syndrome is fatty casts and albumin, which is option C. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,True
"A 68-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient psychiatry clinic from the medical clinic. The patient is being treated for urge incontinence but is being referred for psychiatric evaluation to help with some of her old avoidance behavior. For the 3 months that she had her urinary symptoms, she avoided places like long lines and long train rides. Even after being successfully treated for her urinary condition, she continues to show restricted social interaction. Which of the following is a true statement regarding the patient's condition?","{'A': 'She fears not being able to escape similar situations.', 'B': 'Her symptoms need to last for at least 1 month.', 'C': 'She requires only one fear or avoidance situation to meet criteria for this condition.', 'D': 'Patients may have accompanying social phobia.', 'E': 'The condition always occurs in the context of panic disorder.'}",A,"The patient's condition is described as avoidance behavior related to her urinary symptoms, which suggests that she is experiencing significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. This is characteristic of agoraphobia, which is a fear or avoidance of places or situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of having a panic attack or panic-like symptoms.

The correct answer is D) Patients may have accompanying social phobia. This is because agoraphobia can be comorbid with social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder), where individuals may avoid social situations due to fear of embarrassment or scrutiny by others.",D,False

His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?","{'A': 'Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline', 'B': 'Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate', 'C': 'Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A', 'D': 'Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate', 'E': 'Arginine to urea and ornithine'}",A,"The patient presents with somnolence, poor feeding, vomiting, high serum ammonia, and increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio in urine. These findings are suggestive of a urea cycle disorder. The urea cycle is responsible for converting ammonia to urea, which is then excreted in the urine. In this patient, the inability to excrete ammonia as urea leads to hyperammonemia.

The enzyme deficiencies in the urea cycle correspond to the reactions listed in the options. The specific enzyme deficiency can be determined by the accumulation of metabolites upstream of the block. In this case, the increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio in urine suggests an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is upstream of the citrulline formation step. This points to a deficiency in the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline, which is option A.

Therefore, the answer is A) Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline.",A,True

The presence of localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field on physical exam indicates a possible pneumonia. The leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 16,500/mm^3) supports the presence of an infection. The patient's confusion could be a manifestation of sepsis or another complication of the infection such as metabolic encephalopathy.

Given the clinical presentation and the need to identify the causative organism quickly to guide antibiotic therapy, the best diagnostic test would be to obtain blood cultures (Option A) to identify the causative pathogen and to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. Chest radiography (Option B) would be useful to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia, but it would not identify the causative organism. A lung biopsy (Option C) is invasive and not typically performed in this setting. Sputum culture (Option D) could be helpful if the patient was able to produce sputum that could be collected, but given the patient's symptoms of confusion and abdominal pain, it may not be feasible or representative of the causative organism. A urine antigen test (Option E) could be useful for certain types of infections like Legionella, but it is not the most comprehensive test to guide therapy in this case.

Therefore, the answer is A) Blood cultures.",A,False

Additionally, the patient has failure to thrive (5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight), and the presence of raised, erythematous lesions that sometimes secrete pus. These findings suggest an underlying immunodeficiency disorder.

Option A, Chronic granulomatous disease, is characterized by recurrent infections due to a defect in phagocyte function. However, the skin lesions described are not typical for this condition.

Option B, Ataxia-telangiectasia, is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, and an increased risk of malignancies. The patient does not have any neurological symptoms or telangiectasias.

Option C, Atopic dermatitis, is a common skin condition that presents with pruritic, eczematous lesions. While atopic dermatitis can be associated with recurrent skin infections, it does not typically present with systemic symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy.

Option D, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections. The presence of petechiae or purpura, which are not mentioned in the vignette, would be more suggestive of this condition.

Option E, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that presents with partial albinism, recurrent infections, and a bleeding tendency due to platelet dysfunction. The presence of giant granules in leukocytes is a characteristic finding. The patient's symptoms do not align well with this diagnosis.

Based on the information provided, none of the options perfectly fit the patient's clinical presentation. However, the closest match would be option C, Atopic dermatitis, given the recurrent skin lesions and history of infections. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes and systemic symptoms may suggest a more severe immunodeficiency, but without additional information",A,True
"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy.

Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?","{'A': 'CD8+ T lymphocytes', 'B': 'Bone marrow-derived macrophages', 'C': 'CD4+ T lymphocytes', 'D': 'Natural killer cells', 'E': 'Band neutrophils'}",D,"The question describes a scenario where a patient has monoclonal gammopathy with a low percentage of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The question asks about a class of immune cells that can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. The description matches the characteristics of natural killer (NK) cells, which are known to kill abnormal cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, without the need for antibody-mediated opsonization. NK cells are a part of the innate immune system and do not require prior sensitization or activation like adaptive immune cells, such as CD8+ T lymphocytes or CD4+ T lymphocytes. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are phagocytic cells that engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens but are not primarily known for lysing abnormal cells without opsonization. Band neutrophils are a type of neutrophil that is part of the innate immune response, but they typically require opsonization to effectively kill pathogens.

Blood pressure is 115/75 mmHG and heart rate is 125/min. Heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. Which of the following best explains the effect of digoxin in this patient?","{'A': 'Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors', 'B': 'Calcium channel blockade', 'C': 'Blockade of Na-K-ATPase on cardiac myocytes', 'D': 'Vagal stimulation', 'E': 'Increased ventricular contractility'}",D,"The patient presents with dyspnea and palpitations, and has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. This is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that has multiple effects on the heart, including increasing the force of myocardial contraction (positive inotropy), slowing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, and increasing vagal (parasympathetic) tone. The initial presentation of the patient suggests that the primary issue is the irregular heart rhythm, likely atrial fibrillation. Digoxin slows conduction through the AV node, which can help to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. The fact that the heart rate dropped from 125/min to 85/min after IV digoxin indicates that digoxin has slowed the ventricular rate. This effect is due to the blockade of Na-K-ATPase on cardiac myocytes, which leads to an increase in intracellular sodium and subsequent inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, resulting in increased intracellular calcium and enhanced contractility. However, the primary clinical effect observed here is the control of heart rate, not contractility. Therefore, the most appropriate option that explains the effect of digoxin in this patient is C) Blockade of Na-K-ATPase on cardiac myocytes.",D,True
"A 20-year-old woman comes to the clinic for her first follow-up visit after being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 1-month ago. At that time, she was acutely severely manic and was brought to the emergency department by her concerned boyfriend. She was started on lithium, and after subsequent improvement, she was discharged. A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?","{'A': 'Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy', 'B': 'Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid', 'C': 'Low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy', 'D': 'Discontinue the medication when conception is confirmed', 'E': 'Switch to valproate as it has safest pregnancy profile'}",A,"The patient is a 20-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder who is currently on lithium. She has had a recent episode of mania which required emergency department admission. She is now compliant with her medications and has no significant complaints. The question asks for a recommendation to minimize the risk to the fetus.

Lithium is known to have potential teratogenic effects, including congenital cardiac anomalies such as Ebstein anomaly. However, discontinuing medication upon conception is not recommended for women with bipolar disorder, as relapse of manic or depressive symptoms can occur and pose a risk to both the mother and fetus.

Option A suggests adjusting dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy. This is a reasonable approach as lithium levels can be monitored and adjusted to maintain therapeutic effect while minimizing potential teratogenic effects.

Option B suggests supplementing all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid. While folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age to prevent neural tube defects, this option does not directly address the specific risks associated with lithium use.

Option C suggests low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy. This statement is not supported by evidence and does not specifically address the risks associated with lithium.

Option D suggests discontinuing the medication when conception is confirmed. As mentioned earlier, this is not recommended due to the risk of relapse.

Option E suggests switching to valproate, which has a safer pregnancy profile. However, valproate is actually associated with a higher risk of teratogenic effects compared to lithium, including neural tube defects and cognitive impairment.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate option to minimize the risk to the fetus would be to closely monitor and adjust the dosage of lithium throughout the pregnancy. Therefore, the answer is A) Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy.",A,True

The chest x-ray shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe, which could be due to a variety of causes including atelectasis, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. Given the patient's hemodynamic instability and the presence of a chest injury with a questionable finding on the chest x-ray, a chest tube should be placed to evacuate any potential hemothorax or pneumothorax and to allow for lung re-expansion. This is an emergent procedure and should be performed as soon as possible. Therefore, the answer is A) Chest tube insertion in the fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line.",A,False
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, has a poor appetite, and has had a problem concentrating for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?","{'A': 'Bupropion', 'B': 'Citalopram', 'C': 'Fluoxetine', 'D': 'Mirtazapine', 'E': 'Trazodone'}",A,"The patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior in high school suggests a possible diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. One of the medications commonly used to treat depression, which can also be effective in bulimia nervosa, is fluoxetine. However, fluoxetine and other SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have been associated with an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviors in some populations, particularly in children and adolescents. Although the patient does not currently have suicidal ideation, there is a history of similar low mood episodes, and the patient has lost interest in previously enjoyed activities, which could potentially increase the risk of suicidal thoughts. Therefore, the medication that should be avoided in this patient is the one associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation. Among the options provided, fluoxetine is the drug that has been most commonly linked to this adverse effect. Therefore, the answer is C) Fluoxetine.",C,False

To answer the question, we need to determine the characteristics of these cells based on the options provided.

A. Lymphocytes do not transform into macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues. Macrophages are derived from monocytes, not lymphocytes.
B. Lymphocytes are indeed responsible for the production of antibodies. This is one of their primary functions, and they do so through a process called clonal selection.
C. CD25 is a marker typically found on activated T cells, not all lymphocytes.
D. Lymphocytes do not normally constitute 25–40% of the total leucocyte count. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cells and usually make up the majority of the leucocyte count.
E. Lymphocytes do have a lymphoid origin, as they are produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus and other lymphoid tissues.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is B) These cells are responsible for the production of antibodies.",A,True
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of fatigue for several weeks. The parents report that their son quit doing sports at school because of low energy. The patient's academic performance has declined recently. He spends most of his time in the basement playing video games and eating bowls of cereal. He has no history of serious illness. His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and his father has major depressive disorder. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the finger nails. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

The laboratory findings support this with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, which is below the normal range for his age. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 μm3 indicates that the anemia is microcytic (MCV < 80 μm3). The red cell distribution width (RDW) of 18% is elevated (>15%), suggesting a mixed population of red blood cells, which is often seen in iron deficiency anemia. The platelet count is within normal limits, and the leukocyte count is also normal.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory findings, iron deficiency anemia is the most likely diagnosis. Iron deficiency anemia can result from inadequate dietary intake, which may be suggested by the patient's dietary habits of eating bowls of cereal.

The most appropriate initial step in treatment for iron deficiency anemia is to address the underlying cause and replenish iron stores. Regular blood transfusions (A) are not indicated in this case as they are reserved for severe anemia with hemodynamic instability or symptomatic anemia. Fluoxetine (B) is an antidepressant and is not indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Methylphenidate (C) is a stimulant used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and is not appropriate for this patient's presentation. Allogenic stem cell transplantation (E) is a treatment for severe, life-threatening anemias and is not indicated in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is iron supplementation (D) to replenish iron stores and correct the anemia.

The answer is D) Iron supplementation.",D,True
"An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother’s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?","{'A': 'Botox', 'B': 'Carbamazepine', 'C': 'Vitamin B12', 'D': 'Methylprednisolone', 'E': 'Ceftriaxone'}",A,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with Bell's palsy, which is a peripheral facial nerve palsy. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression, and damage to it can result in the inability to close one eye, drooping of the mouth on the affected side, and lack of wrinkles on the forehead due to paralysis of the facial muscles. The fact that the patient's symptoms have not improved with corticosteroids suggests that the diagnosis of Bell's palsy is likely, as corticosteroids are typically used to treat inflammation associated with Bell's palsy.

Given that the patient's symptoms have persisted and there is no sensory loss, the neurologist may recommend a treatment to help relieve her symptoms. Botox (A) is not a treatment for Bell's palsy; it is used for conditions like muscle spasticity and wrinkles. Carbamazepine (B) is an anticonvulsant and is not indicated for Bell's palsy. Vitamin B12 (C) deficiency does not cause Bell's palsy. Methylprednisolone (D) is a corticosteroid, and since the patient has already been given a course of corticosteroids without full recovery, it is unlikely that further corticosteroids would be recommended. Ceftriaxone (E) is an antibiotic and is not indicated for Bell's palsy unless there is a specific indication for antibiotic treatment.

Therefore, the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient is D) Methylprednisolone.",B,False

The presence of nitrite and white blood cell casts in the urine further supports the diagnosis of a complicated UTI.

Given the patient's symptoms, history, and laboratory findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against many urinary pathogens and is often used to treat complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis.

Physical examination reveals constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, and mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. The presence of constricted pupils and the use of an anti-diarrheal medication suggest the possibility of opioid use, which can cause constipation and pupillary constriction. The patient's shallow breathing could be consistent with opioid-induced respiratory depression. The abdominal symptoms and the use of an anti-diarrheal also raise the possibility of an opioid overdose, which can present with abdominal pain and decreased bowel sounds.

Given these considerations, the next best step in management would be to administer naloxone (option A), an opioid antagonist, to reverse the potential opioid overdose. This would address the respiratory depression and gastrointestinal symptoms if they are indeed due to opioid overdose.

The pain wakes her from sleep, suggesting that it may be more pronounced at night. There are no common preceding events to pain onset, and her physical examination is unremarkable. Given the characteristics of the pain and the absence of any significant past medical history or risk factors such as smoking, the most likely diagnosis is unstable angina or a variant (Prinzmetal's) angina.

Unstable angina is characterized by episodes of chest pain that occur at rest or with minimal exertion and are often unpredictable. It is typically caused by coronary artery vasospasm or atherosclerosis. The ECG may be normal or show ST-segment changes during an episode of pain.

Option A, Aspirin, is used for its antiplatelet effects in the setting of acute coronary syndrome or as a preventive measure in patients with established cardiovascular disease. However, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for recurrent chest pain due to unstable angina.

Option B, Digoxin, is a cardiac glycoside used primarily for heart failure and certain arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. It is not indicated for the treatment of unstable angina.

Option C, Isosorbide dinitrate, is a nitrate used for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris. Nitrates work by dilating the coronary arteries and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. They can be effective in preventing episodes of chest pain in patients with stable and unstable angina.

Option D, Heparin, is an anticoagulant used in the acute setting of myocardial infarction or when there is a high suspicion of thrombotic events, such as in acute coronary syndromes. It is not typically used as a first-line treatment for recurrent chest pain due to unstable angina.

Option E, Propranolol, is a beta-blocker that is used in the management of various cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and angina. Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand by slowing the heart rate and reducing contractility. They are effective",A,False

Which of the following best describes the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process?,"{'A': 'Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death', 'B': 'Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption', 'C': 'Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract', 'D': 'Inhibition of elongation factor-2 (EF-2), resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells', 'E': 'Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells'}",E,"The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea following the consumption of undercooked ground beef suggest an infection with a strain of Escherichia coli, specifically E. coli O157:H7. This strain produces Shiga toxin, which is known to cause such symptoms. Shiga toxin works by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells. Therefore, the correct answer is E) Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells.",E,True
A 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure (CHF) was started on an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide. Which of the following would he expect to experience?,"{'A': 'Increased water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts', 'B': 'Vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, aldosterone release', 'C': 'Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation', 'D': 'Increased renal absorption of sodium and water', 'E': 'Increased plasma calcium and decreased renal reabsorption of phosphate'}",C,"The experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide would be expected to produce effects similar to those of the naturally occurring hormone. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released from the atria of the heart in response to volume expansion and increased atrial pressure. Its primary actions include:

1. Vasodilation: ANP causes dilation of blood vessels, leading to decreased peripheral resistance and a decrease in blood pressure.
2. Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR): ANP increases the GFR, promoting the excretion of sodium and water.
3. Inhibition of aldosterone release: ANP inhibits the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in turn reduces the reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules.

Based on these actions, the correct answer is the one that includes increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, and vascular smooth muscle dilation.

Therefore, the answer is C) Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.",C,True
"A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:
Screening test\gold standard Disease present Disease absent
Positive 45 15
Negative 5 35
Which of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?","{'A': 'The new screening test has greater statistical power than the gold standard.', 'B': 'Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test.', 'C': 'The power of the test is 0.8.', 'D': 'If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase.', 'E': 'If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.'}",E,"The statistical power of a test is the probability that it will correctly reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., detect an effect when there is an effect to be detected). It is determined by the effect size, the sample size, and the significance level.

To calculate the statistical power of the screening test, we need to know the sensitivity, specificity, prevalence of the disease, and the significance level (usually set at 0.05). However, the information provided in the table does not include all these parameters.

Nevertheless, we can make some observations based on the given data:

- The sensitivity of the screening test is 45/50 = 0.9 or 90%. This means that 90% of the true positives are correctly identified by the screening test.
- The specificity is 35/35 = 1 or 100%. This means that 100% of the true negatives are correctly identified by the screening test.
- The positive predictive value (PPV) is 45/50 = 0.9 or 90%. This means that 90% of the positive test results are true positives.
- The negative predictive value (NPV) is 35/35 = 1 or 100%. This means that 100% of the negative test results are true negatives.

Based on these observations, we can eliminate some options:

- Option A suggests that the new screening test has greater statistical power than the gold standard. Without additional information, we cannot determine the statistical power of the gold standard or compare it with the new screening test. So, we cannot confirm this statement.
- Option B states that repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test. This is incorrect because the statistical power can be affected by various factors, including sample size and effect size.
- Option C claims that the power of the test is 0.8. This is also incorrect because the power cannot be determined without knowing the effect size, significance level, and sample size.
- Option D suggests that if the specificity of the screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase. This is generally true because increasing specificity reduces false positives, which improves the test's ability to correctly identify true negatives.
- Option E states that if the sensitivity",A,False
"A 20-year-old woman in the army recruit collapses during an especially hot day at basic training. She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event. Two weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory infection (URI) but has since recovered. Her father has chronic kidney disease (CKD), bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems. At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?","{'A': 'A mutation of the COL4A5 gene', 'B': 'Neisseria meningitides', 'C': 'Heat exhaustion', 'D': 'Heat stroke', 'E': 'IgA nephropathy'}",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by muscle breakdown and release of intracellular muscle constituents (myoglobin) into the bloodstream. This can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), as myoglobin is nephrotoxic. The patient's symptoms of severe bilateral flank pain, generalized myalgia, and tea-colored urine support this diagnosis. The absence of RBCs or WBCs in the urinalysis despite a positive dipstick for blood is also indicative of rhabdomyolysis, as the blood in the urine is from muscle breakdown rather than from bleeding within the urinary tract.

The most likely cause of rhabdomyolysis in this case is heat stroke (option D), which is a severe form of heat illness that occurs when the body's temperature regulation fails. Heat stroke can lead to hyperthermia, as evidenced by the patient's high temperature of 40.3°C (104.5°F). It also causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which can result in altered mental status and dry, hot, erythematous skin.

Heat exhaustion (option C) is a milder form of heat illness and does not typically result in severe hyperthermia or rhabdomyolysis.

Neisseria meningitides (option B) is a bacterium that can cause meningitis and other infections but is not associated with rhabdomyolysis.

IgA nephropathy (option E) is a type of glomerulonephritis that can present with hematuria but would not explain the severe hyperthermia, altered mental status, and other systemic symptoms seen in this patient.

A mutation of the COL4A5 gene (option A) is associated with Alport syndrome, which can cause kidney disease but does not present with acute symptoms like those seen in this patient.

Therefore, the answer is D) Heat stroke.",A,False
"A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?","{'A': 'Disclose the error to the patient but leave it out of the operative report', 'B': 'Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report', 'C': 'Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake', 'D': 'Report the physician to the ethics committee', 'E': 'Refuse to dictate the operative report'}",C,The correct answer is B) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.,B,False
A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of multiple episodes of small amounts of blood in his stools. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. His hemoglobin concentration is 8.3 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 72μm3. Colonoscopy shows a 2.3-cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the lesion is shown. Which of the following processes is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?,"{'A': 'Underexpression of COX-2', 'B': 'Increased activity of c-KIT', 'C': 'Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine', 'D': 'Impaired degradation of β-catenin', 'E': 'Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of blood in the stools, pale conjunctivae, and low hemoglobin concentration suggest anemia, which is confirmed by the laboratory findings of a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The presence of a polypoid mass in the ascending colon and the low MCV are suggestive of a colorectal neoplasm, most likely a carcinoma given the size of the lesion. The pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma often involves the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, which is characterized by the accumulation of genetic mutations that lead to dysplasia and eventually cancer. One of the key molecular pathways involved in this process is the Wnt signaling pathway, where β-catenin plays a critical role. In the majority of colorectal cancers, there is impaired degradation of β-catenin, leading to its accumulation in the cell and subsequent activation of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation. Therefore, the answer is D) Impaired degradation of β-catenin.",D,True
"An 8-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with respiratory distress, facial edema, and a skin rash after eating a buffet dinner with her family. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery, has met all developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. Past medical history is significant for mild allergies to pet dander and ragweed, as well as a severe peanut allergy. She also has asthma. She normally carries both an emergency inhaler and EpiPen but forgot them today. Family history is noncontributory. The vital signs include: blood pressure 112/87 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following options, which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?","{'A': 'IM epinephrine', 'B': 'oral diphenhydramine', 'C': 'IV epinephrine', 'D': 'extra-strength topical diphenhydramine', 'E': 'inhaled sodium cromolyn - mast cell stabilizer'}",A,"The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, which is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The symptoms of respiratory distress, facial edema, and skin rash following exposure to a known allergen (peanuts in this case) are classic for anaphylaxis. The patient's history of severe peanut allergy supports this diagnosis. Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with epinephrine.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to administer epinephrine. Since the patient forgot her EpiPen, it is crucial that she receives it as soon as possible. The intramuscular (IM) route is preferred over the intravenous (IV) route for initial treatment of anaphylaxis because it provides a more reliable and rapid absorption. Oral medications such as diphenhydramine and inhaled sodium cromolyn are not appropriate for immediate treatment of anaphylaxis. Topical diphenhydramine would not be effective for systemic symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is A) IM epinephrine.",A,True
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for two weeks of low-grade fever and sore throat. Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month. On workup, he is found to have an HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL with a CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3. He is started on medical therapy.

Option A: Azithromycin is an antibiotic and is not used in the treatment of HIV.
Option B: Dapsone is used in the treatment of leprosy and certain skin conditions like dermatitis herpetiformis, but it is not part of the standard treatment regimen for HIV.
Option C: Fluconazole is an antifungal medication and would not be included in the treatment regimen for HIV unless there was a concurrent fungal infection.
Option D: Folinic acid (also known as leucovorin) is used as a supplement in certain chemotherapy regimens and in patients taking methotrexate, but it is not a standard component of HIV therapy.

"A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.

Bioavailability: 50%
Drug half-life: 2 hours
Volume of distribution: 14.3 liters

Which of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?","{'A': '150 milligrams', 'B': '430 milligrams', 'C': '600 milligrams', 'D': '1200 milligrams', 'E': '3600 milligrams'}",D,"To calculate the maintenance dose of the drug, we need to consider the bioavailability, half-life, and volume of distribution.

The maintenance dose can be calculated using the following formula:
Maintenance dose = (Desired plasma concentration / Bioavailability) x Volume of distribution

Given:
Desired plasma concentration = 15 mg/L
Bioavailability = 50%
Volume of distribution = 14.3 liters

Let's plug these values into the formula:
Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L / 0.5) x 14.3 liters
Maintenance dose = (30 mg/L) x 14.3 liters
Maintenance dose = 439 mg

Since the dose needs to be given every 8 hours, we need to calculate the dose per dosing interval.
Dose per dosing interval = Maintenance dose / Dosing frequency
Dose per dosing interval = 439 mg / 8 hours
Dose per dosing interval = 55 mg

The closest answer choice to 55 mg is 600 milligrams (option C). Therefore, the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours is 600 milligrams.

Therefore, the answer is C) 600 milligrams.",C,False

He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs. A chest plain film shows clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve.

These symptoms, along with the finding of a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI and vegetations involving the mitral valve on echocardiography, are suggestive of infective endocarditis. The presence of non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles is also a common finding in infective endocarditis.

The patient's history of frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer is relevant. There is an established association between infective endocarditis and gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly colorectal cancer. This is known as Trousseau's syndrome.

Among the listed organisms, Streptococcus bovis (also known as Streptococcus gallolyticus) is known to be associated with colorectal cancer and infective endocarditis. It is part of the gut flora and is often implicated in endocarditis in patients with underlying gastrointestinal pathology.

Kingella kingae is more commonly associated with endocarditis in children. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of acute endocarditis but is not specifically associated with gastrointestinal malignancies. Escherichia coli can cause endocarditis but is less commonly associated with colorectal cancer. Haemophilus aphrophilus is a less common cause of endocarditis and is not specifically associated with gastrointestinal malignancies.

Therefore, the most likely causative agent in this case, considering the patient's history of colorectal cancer, is Streptococcus bovis.

He is not able to sit upright on his own. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 150/min, and respirations are 50/min. His tongue protrudes beyond the teeth. Neck veins are distended. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. He has 2+ reflexes bilaterally. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. Which of the following is the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient?","{'A': 'Muscle glycogen phosphorylase', 'B': 'Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase', 'C': 'Lysosomal acid maltase', 'D': 'Glucose-6-phosphatase', 'E': 'Glycogen debranching enzyme'}",C,"The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, difficulty feeding, failure to thrive (evidenced by being at the 25th percentile for weight and 75th percentile for height), hypotonia, cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly, are suggestive of a glycogen storage disease (GSD). The presence of crackles at the lung bases and an S3 gallop on cardiac examination may indicate pulmonary and cardiac involvement, respectively. The finding that the patient's tongue protrudes beyond the teeth suggests macroglossia, which is commonly associated with GSDs.

The enzyme deficiencies associated with the different types of GSDs are as follows:

A) Muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency is associated with GSD type V (McArdle disease), which primarily affects skeletal muscle.
B) Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is associated with GSD type I (von Gierke disease), which is characterized by severe hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and growth retardation.
C) Lysosomal acid maltase deficiency is associated with GSD type II (Pompe disease), which can present with cardiomegaly, hypotonia, and muscle weakness.
D) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is associated with GSD type I (von Gierke disease), the same type associated with very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
E) Glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency is associated with GSD type III (Cori or Forbes disease), which can present with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and muscle weakness.

Given the patient's symptoms, including cardiomegaly, hypotonia, and hepatomegaly, the most likely diagnosis is GSD type II (Pompe disease), which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid maltase. Therefore, the answer is C) Lysosomal acid maltase.",C,True

An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities?","{'A': 'Abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis', 'B': 'Capillary leakage', 'C': 'Decreased cardiac output', 'D': 'Increased excretion of water', 'E': 'Pseudocyst formation'}",B,"The patient presents with upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, hypotension, tachycardia, and epigastric tenderness with guarding. The laboratory studies show an elevated hematocrit, leukocyte count, and amylase level. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia. These findings are suggestive of acute pancreatitis, which is characterized by abdominal pain, nausea, and elevated amylase levels. Acute pancreatitis can lead to hypotension and tachycardia due to fluid sequestration in the inflamed pancreas and peripancreatic tissues, resulting in decreased intravascular volume (capillary leakage). Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities is B) Capillary leakage.",E,False
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness.

Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?","{'A': 'Increase in serum ACTH', 'B': 'Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids', 'C': 'Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol', 'D': 'Increase in serum cortisol', 'E': 'Increase in urine metanephrines'}",A,"The metyrapone stimulation test is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Metyrapone inhibits the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, which is involved in cortisol synthesis. In a normal individual, the administration of metyrapone would lead to an increase in ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) as the body attempts to stimulate the adrenal gland to produce more cortisol. This increase in ACTH would lead to an increase in the production of 11-deoxycortisol, which is a precursor to cortisol. Therefore, the most likely change in laboratory findings following the administration of metyrapone in a patient without adrenal insufficiency would be an increase in serum ACTH.",A,True
An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?,"{'A': 'Exenatide', 'B': 'Sitagliptin', 'C': 'Glimepiride', 'D': 'Canagliflozin', 'E': 'Pioglitazone'}",B,"The experimental new drug increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium, which in turn increases glucose-dependent insulin production. Incretins are hormones that, among other effects, increase insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner.

Option A, Exenatide, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics the action of endogenous incretins but does not prevent their degradation.

Option B, Sitagliptin, is a DPP-4 inhibitor that prevents the degradation of endogenous incretins, thereby increasing their levels and promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion.

Option C, Glimepiride, is a sulfonylurea that directly stimulates insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells but does not affect the levels or degradation of incretins.

Option D, Canagliflozin, is an SGLT2 inhibitor that prevents renal reabsorption of glucose but does not have a direct effect on incretin levels or their degradation.

Option E, Pioglitazone, is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity but does not affect the levels or degradation of incretins.

Based on the information provided, the drug with a mechanism of action most similar to the experimental new drug is Sitagliptin (Option B), as it also increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation. Therefore, the answer is B) Sitagliptin.",A,False
A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of pain during sexual intercourse for 6 months. She also reports frequent episodes of crampy pelvic pain that starts one day before menses and lasts for 7 days. Her symptoms are not relieved with pain medication. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband. She uses a combined oral contraceptive pill. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,"{'A': 'Measurement of CA-125 levels', 'B': 'Hysterectomy', 'C': 'Laparoscopy', 'D': 'Hysteroscopy', 'E': 'CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis'}",C,"The patient is experiencing dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) and cyclic pelvic pain that coincides with her menstrual cycle. The absence of abnormalities on transvaginal ultrasonography and negative cervical and urethral swabs make significant pelvic pathology less likely. Measurement of CA-125 levels (A) is not indicated in this case as it is a tumor marker primarily used in the evaluation of ovarian cancer, and there is no indication of ovarian pathology. Hysterectomy (B) is a definitive surgical treatment for uterine fibroids, which is not supported by the patient's history or ultrasonography findings. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (E) is not the most appropriate next step as it involves radiation exposure and is not typically used in the initial evaluation of dyspareunia or cyclic pelvic pain. Hysteroscopy (D) allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity and may be useful in evaluating causes of abnormal uterine bleeding but is less likely to provide diagnostic information in this patient with normal menstrual cycles and no abnormalities on ultrasonography.

Laparoscopy (C) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that allows direct visualization of the pelvic organs and can be used to evaluate the cause of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia when the initial workup is inconclusive. It may help diagnose conditions such as endometriosis, which is a common cause of these symptoms and can be present despite normal ultrasonography findings. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is laparoscopy.

The laboratory findings show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated bilirubin with a predominantly indirect bilirubin. These findings are suggestive of a hemolytic anemia. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is used to confirm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which can be seen with diseases such as hemolytic disease of the newborn, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and some types of thrombocytopenia. Given the patient's recent travel to an area endemic for malaria and the clinical presentation, a thick and thin blood smear would be the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of malaria. However, since malaria is not listed as an option, the next best choice to explain the hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in the context of recent travel to Brazil would be the direct antiglobulin test, which could be positive in hemolytic diseases including those secondary to infections such as malaria. Therefore, the answer is B) Direct antiglobulin test.",B,False

A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?,"{'A': 'Lesser sac', 'B': 'Rectouterine pouch', 'C': 'Hepatorenal space', 'D': 'Splenorenal angle', 'E': 'Rectovesical pouch'}",B,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of a ruptured ovarian cyst. This condition typically causes acute onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain, often accompanied by signs of peritoneal irritation such as rebound tenderness. The pain is usually localized to the area of the affected ovary. In this case, the patient has tenderness over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant, which suggests involvement of the left ovary.

When an ovarian cyst ruptures, the contents of the cyst (which may include blood, fluid, or the ovarian tissue itself) are released into the peritoneal cavity. The fluid can accumulate in various potential spaces around the abdomen.

The lesser sac of the peritoneal cavity is an anteriorly located space that lies between the stomach and the transverse colon. It is a common site for fluid accumulation following the rupture of an ovarian cyst.

The rectouterine pouch, also known as the pouch of Douglas, is the most dependent part of the peritoneal cavity in a woman when she is in the supine position. Fluid in this area could be due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or other causes of intra-abdominal bleeding, but it is less commonly associated with a ruptured ovarian cyst.

The hepatorenal space, located between the liver and the kidneys, is not a typical site for fluid accumulation secondary to a ruptured ovarian cyst.

The splenorenal angle, also known as the left upper quadrant, is not a typical site for fluid accumulation secondary to a ruptured ovarian cyst.

The rectovesical pouch is an anteriorly located space in the pelvis, but it is not a common site for fluid accumulation following the rupture of an ovarian cyst.

Based on this information, the most likely location for fluid due to a ruptured ovarian cyst would be the lesser sac. Therefore, the answer is A) Lesser sac.",A,False

The laboratory findings indicate an elevated leukocyte count and ESR, suggesting an inflammatory process. The synovial fluid analysis shows a high white blood cell count, which is consistent with inflammation, and the presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals, which are characteristic of gout. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints due to hyperuricemia.

The underlying causes of hyperuricemia include increased production or decreased excretion of uric acid. The options provided are potential causes of hyperuricemia.

Option A suggests organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion. This is not a typical cause of hyperuricemia.
Option B suggests increased renal reabsorption of urate, which is a possible cause of hyperuricemia.
Option C suggests lysis of large numbers of cells, which can release intracellular urate and contribute to hyperuricemia, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.
Option D suggests a deficiency of HGPRT, which is associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that leads to hyperuricemia, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.
Option E suggests a high-purine diet, which can lead to increased production of uric acid and is a common cause of hyperuricemia.

Considering the patient's history of smoking, alcohol use, and the acute presentation of gout, the most likely underlying cause of his condition is related to increased production of uric acid, which could be due to dietary factors such as a high-purine diet. Therefore, the answer is E) High-purine diet.",A,True

Given the geographic history, the most likely diagnosis is onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus. This condition is transmitted by blackflies that breed in fast-flowing rivers, and it is endemic in parts of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.

The drug of choice for onchocerciasis is Ivermectin (option C). Ivermectin is effective in killing the microfilariae (early larval stage of the parasite) and preventing further eye damage. Benznidazole (option A) is used to treat Chagas disease, which is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and not consistent with the patient's presentation. Diethylcarbamazine (option B) is used for lymphatic filariasis and some other parasitic infections but is not the first-line treatment for onchocerciasis.

The presence of crackles over the bibasilar lung fields and patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray suggests pneumonia. The leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 16,000/mm3) supports the presence of an infection. The patient's mild hypokalemia (potassium of 4.7 mEq/L) and mild hyponatremia (sodium of 131 mEq/L) could be related to his gastrointestinal symptoms and possibly his renal function, as indicated by a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, which is at the upper limit of normal.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The choice of pharmacotherapy should cover the most common pathogens responsible for CAP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.

Option A, Levofloxacin, is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity, including coverage for the typical and atypical pathogens that cause CAP. It is an appropriate choice for empirical treatment of CAP in a patient who does not have any known drug allergies or other contraindications to fluoroquinolones.

Option B, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, is a combination antibiotic that also covers a broad range of bacteria but is not the first-line treatment for CAP in most cases.

Option C, Amoxicillin, is a penicillin antibiotic that is effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae but has limited coverage for other common CAP pathogens, especially atypical bacteria.

Option D, Oseltamivir, is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza. There is no clear indication that this patient has influenza, as his symptoms are more consistent",A,True
"A 50-year-old woman is brought to the office by her daughter with a chief complaint of finger pain in her left hand. She is slightly confused and can’t remember when the pain started. Her daughter states that the pain has been present for approximately one month. She expresses concern that her mother has been progressively more confused during the past week. She reports that her mother also has had worsening nausea for several months. The patient’s vital signs are heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), and blood pressure 120/86 mm Hg. Upon physical examination, the patient reports pain when the fingers of the left hand are palpated, and small palpable tumors are visible on the fingers.

The X-ray findings of thin bones with brown tumors and osteolysis of the distal phalanges are characteristic of hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to hypercalcemia and subsequent deposition of calcium in soft tissues, resulting in brown tumors. Therefore, the most likely cause for this patient’s condition is A) Hyperparathyroidism.",A,True
"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Femoropopliteal artery stenosis', 'B': 'Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery', 'C': 'Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein', 'D': 'Lumbar spinal stenosis', 'E': 'Aortoiliac artery stenosis\n""'}",A,"The patient's symptoms of tingling pain in the sole of the foot and calf cramps that occur with exercise and are relieved by rest are suggestive of claudication. The absence of pain at rest and the presence of pain on exertion are characteristic of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The absence of pedal pulses on the affected side further supports this diagnosis. The straight leg raise test eliciting pallor and tingling pain in the foot indicates the presence of critical limb ischemia, which is a medical emergency. The patient's history of smoking and type 2 diabetes mellitus are risk factors for PAD. The most likely cause of these symptoms is acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein, which can lead to acute limb ischemia. Therefore, the answer is C) Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein.",C,False
"A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","{'A': 'Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion', 'B': 'Administer ampicillin and progesterone', 'C': 'Administer ampicillin and test amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity', 'D': 'Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section', 'E': 'Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor'}",D,"The patient presents with clear vaginal discharge at 32 weeks' gestation, which is suggestive of premature rupture of membranes (PROM). The speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os, and Nitrazine testing is positive, both of which support the diagnosis of PROM. The fetal heart rate is reactive and normal, and there are no decelerations, indicating that the fetus is not in distress. Tocometry shows uterine contractions, which could be a sign of preterm labor.

Given the diagnosis of PROM, the patient is at risk for infection, and antibiotic therapy is indicated. The choice of antibiotic should cover both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ampicillin is commonly used for this purpose.

The next step in management depends on the gestational age and the presence of labor. Since the patient is at 32 weeks and has uterine contractions, there is a concern for preterm labor. Corticosteroids, such as betamethasone, are administered to accelerate fetal lung maturity when preterm birth is anticipated.

The decision between cesarean section and induction of labor should be based on obstetric indications, which are not provided in the question. However, since the fetal heart rate is reactive and normal, and there are no decelerations, it suggests that the fetus is not in immediate distress. This may lean towards attempting labor induction before proceeding to cesarean section.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity and ampicillin for infection prophylaxis, and then proceed with induction of labor, unless there are specific obstetric indications for cesarean section.

Therefore, the answer is E) Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor.",E,False
"A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a ""hacking"" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.

Which of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?","{'A': 'Humidified oxygen and dexamethasone; discharge if the patient improves', 'B': 'Discharge from the emergency department without treatment', 'C': 'Dexamethasome, racemic epinephrine and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits', 'D': 'Broncoscopy to remove a foreign body in the upper airway then discharge', 'E': 'Empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics, intubate and admission'}",C,"The child's presentation with a ""hacking"" cough followed by respiratory distress and a high-pitched noise with every breath suggests a foreign body airway obstruction. The absence of toys or other small objects in the bed does not rule out the possibility of a foreign body being ingested earlier in the day. Given the acute presentation and the need for immediate intervention, the most appropriate management would be to secure the airway and remove the obstruction.

Therefore, the answer is D) Bronchoscopy to remove a foreign body in the upper airway then discharge.",D,False
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?","{'A': 'High IgM, low IgA, and IgE', 'B': 'Low IgA, high IgG, normal IgE', 'C': 'Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM', 'D': 'High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG', 'E': 'Normal serum immunoglobulin values'}",C,"The patient's reaction to the blood transfusion suggests an allergic reaction, which could be due to an immunodeficiency disorder. In such cases, there is often an imbalance in the levels of immunoglobulins. The most common immunodeficiency disorder associated with allergic reactions is selective IgA deficiency. This condition is characterized by low levels of IgA, which is the main immunoglobulin found in mucosal areas such as the gut, respiratory tract, and urogenital tract. IgA deficiency can lead to recurrent infections in these areas and may also cause allergic reactions to blood products containing IgA.

Given this information, the most likely scenario for this patient would be low IgA levels. The other immunoglobulin levels (IgM, IgG, and IgE) are not specifically indicated by the information provided, and there is no mention of symptoms or history suggestive of deficiencies or excesses in those immunoglobulins. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be:

The answer is C) Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM.",C,True

Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition?","{'A': 'Intravenous nitroprusside', 'B': 'Intranasal sumatriptan', 'C': 'Hyperbaric oxygen therapy', 'D': '100% oxygen therapy', 'E': 'Heliox therapy'}",C,"The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presents with nausea, headache, and agitation, and her symptoms started after being at a lakeside cabin. She has a history of hypertension and ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a pulse of 110/min and elevated blood pressure at 154/92 mm Hg. She is confused and has an unsteady gait but no other physical abnormalities.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and the fact that she ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications, her symptoms may be related to a hypertensive crisis. Hypertensive crises can present with headache, nausea, confusion, and other neurological symptoms. The best immediate treatment for a hypertensive crisis is to lower the blood pressure in a controlled manner.

Option A, Intravenous nitroprusside, is a potent vasodilator used to lower blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies. It acts quickly and allows for precise control of blood pressure.

Option B, Intranasal sumatriptan, is used for acute migraine attacks but does not address the patient's elevated blood pressure.

Option C, Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, is used for conditions such as decompression sickness and chronic wounds but is not indicated for hypertensive crises.

Option D, 100% oxygen therapy, can be used for patients with hypoxemia or certain respiratory conditions but does not directly lower blood pressure.

Option E, Heliox therapy, is a mixture of helium and oxygen used for obstructive lung diseases and is not indicated for hypertensive crises.

Considering the patient's presentation and the need to lower her blood pressure in a controlled manner, the most appropriate intervention is intravenous nitroprusside.

Therefore, the answer is A) Intravenous nitroprusside.",A,False

The pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary, and there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein, suggesting a possible ovarian torsion. The ovarian torsion involves the twisting of the ovarian pedicle, which includes the ovarian vessels and the ligamentous supports. Among the options given, the infundibulopelvic ligament is the ligament that contains the ovarian vessels and is involved in ovarian torsion. Therefore, the answer is E) Infundibulopelvic ligament.",E,True
A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?,"{'A': 'Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes', 'B': 'Glomerular crescents with macrophages', 'C': 'Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation', 'D': 'Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy', 'E': 'Thickened glomerular capillary loops'}",D,"The patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections and the findings of bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis and retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition suggest a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). VUR is characterized by the abnormal retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes into the kidneys during micturition.

Histologic examination in cases of VUR typically does not show diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes (A), glomerular crescents with macrophages (B), or thickened glomerular capillary loops (E). These findings are more indicative of inflammatory or immune-mediated processes such as interstitial nephritis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, or membranous nephropathy, respectively.

Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation (C) is a characteristic finding in chronic pyelonephritis, which can result from recurrent UTIs and VUR. Over time, recurrent infections can lead to scarring and atrophy of the renal tubules and interstitium, as well as mesangial proliferation in the glomeruli.

Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy (D) is a finding associated with chronic kidney disease and reflects long-standing damage to the renal parenchyma.

Given the clinical context of recurrent UTIs and the findings of VUR, the most likely histologic finding in this patient's kidney biopsy would be matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation, which is consistent with chronic pyelonephritis secondary to VUR.

Therefore, the answer is C) Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation.",C,False
"A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?","{'A': 'Glycine', 'B': 'Proline', 'C': 'Tyrosine', 'D': 'Lysine', 'E': 'Arginine'}",A,"The patient's symptoms of easy bruising, bleeding gums, and petechiae are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The temporal wasting and thin appearance may suggest malnutrition or a specific nutritional deficiency. The most common cause of such a clinical picture is scurvy, which is due to a deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is an essential cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline residues during the synthesis of collagen. Without this hydroxylation step, collagen synthesis is impaired, leading to the symptoms seen in scurvy. Therefore, the defective synthesis of a substance composed primarily of the amino acid proline is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms. The answer is B) Proline.",B,False
"A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. 90 minutes ago, the patient was found by a neighbor unarousable on the couch with multiple empty bottles of medication on the floor next to her.

This scenario typically presents with a fluctuating level of consciousness and altered mental status.

Option A (Hallucinations) can occur in various conditions, including delirium tremens, which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal, but it is not the most likely finding in this acute presentation.

Option B (Insidious course) is not consistent with the acute onset suggested by the history provided.

Option C (Irreversibility) is not likely since the patient's symptoms are acute and there is no information suggesting permanent damage.

Option D (Multi-infarct dementia) is a type of dementia caused by multiple strokes and would not typically present acutely or be related to medication overdose.

Option E (Normal vital signs) is the most likely additional finding since an overdose or poisoning does not necessarily affect vital signs unless the toxic ingestion leads to significant cardiovascular or respiratory complications.

Therefore, the answer is E) Normal vital signs.",A,True

"A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?","{'A': 'PPV decreases, NPV decreases', 'B': 'PPV decreases, NPV increases', 'C': 'PPV increases, NPV decreases', 'D': 'PPV increases, NPV increases', 'E': 'PPV unchanged, NPV unchanged'}",B,"The positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. The negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly do not have the disease.

In this scenario, the imaging test has a sensitivity of 50% (it correctly identifies 20 out of 40 patients with CMV retinitis, which is the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives). The specificity is also 50% (it correctly identifies 30 out of 40 patients without CMV retinitis, which is the number of true negatives plus the number of false positives).

If the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the number of true positives will decrease (since there are fewer cases of the disease), and the number of false positives will increase (since a larger proportion of the population without the disease will test positive). This means that the sensitivity will decrease and the specificity will increase.

The PPV is the ratio of true positives to (true positives + false positives), and the NPV is the ratio of true negatives to (true negatives + false negatives). As sensitivity decreases (with a fixed specificity), the number of false positives will increase relative to true positives, causing the PPV to decrease. As specificity increases (with a fixed sensitivity), the number of false negatives will decrease relative to true negatives, causing the NPV to increase.

Therefore, the answer is B) PPV decreases, NPV increases.",B,True

In the case of ovarian cancer metastasizing to the brain, the lymphatic route would involve several key steps.

First, the lymphatic drainage of the ovaries primarily flows into the para-aortic lymph nodes. From there, the lymph can travel through various routes. However, for metastasis to occur, the lymph must eventually reach the venous system to be carried to distant sites.

Option A suggests a route that involves the left lumbar trunk and the cisterna chyli, which is a collecting reservoir of lymph located at the level of the thoracic duct. However, the thoracic duct drains lymph from the body parts above the diaphragm, so this route would not be typical for ovarian cancer.

Option B also involves the thoracic duct but on the left side, which again is not involved in draining lymph from the ovaries.

Option C correctly identifies the sentinel node and the right lumbar trunk, which is involved in draining lymph from the pelvic region, including the ovaries. The lymph then passes through the cisterna chyli and enters the right bronchomediastinal trunk. From there, it can reach the right lymphatic duct and eventually be transported via the right subclavian vein into the systemic circulation, potentially allowing metastasis to the brain.

Option D incorrectly suggests the involvement of the left subclavian vein, which is not typically involved in the lymphatic drainage of the ovaries.

Option E suggests a route that is anatomically incorrect for lymphatic drainage of the ovaries.

Therefore, the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain would be through the right lumbar trunk, cisterna chyli, right bronchomediastinal trunk, right lymphatic duct, and right subclavian vein before entering the systemic",A,False
"A 4-month-old infant is brought to the office by his parents due to sudden nose bleeding without trauma of any kind. He has a 1-month history of multiple bruising that measures 1 cm in diameter each in the hands and feet, and tiny red spots that appeared in the upper and lower extremities without any trauma either. He has no prior bleeding history nor any relevant family history. The vital signs include: heart rate 190/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 99/42 mm Hg, and temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F). His physical exam shows pale skin color, petechiae in the soft palate and in the upper and lower extremities as well as ecchymosis in the back of the hands and feet.
The complete blood count results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 41%
Leukocyte count 10,500/mm3
Neutrophils 53%
Bands 2%
Eosinophils 1%

The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while a platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Von Willebrand disease', 'B': 'Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia', 'C': 'Aspirin', 'D': 'Bernard-Soulier disease', 'E': 'Scurvy'}",B,"The patient presents with symptoms of a bleeding disorder, including spontaneous nosebleeds, multiple bruising, and petechiae without any history of trauma. The vital signs show tachycardia and pallor. The complete blood count reveals a low hemoglobin level and hematocrit, indicating anemia. The leukocyte count is within normal limits, and the platelet count is elevated. The coagulation tests show a normal prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), but an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The fibrinogen level is within normal limits. The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while the platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased.

Based on these findings, the most likely cause of the patient’s condition is a platelet function disorder. Von Willebrand disease (Option A) and Bernard-Soulier disease (Option D) are both platelet function disorders, but the normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin makes Bernard-Soulier disease less likely. Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (Option B) is another platelet function disorder characterized by the inability of platelets to aggregate, but this condition typically presents with a normal platelet count and an abnormal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin, which is not the case here.

Aspirin (Option C) can cause platelet dysfunction, but it would not explain the normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin or the absence of a family history of bleeding. Scurvy (Option E) is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C and can lead to bleeding symptoms due to defective collagen synthesis, but it would not explain the normal coagulation tests and the presence of large platelets.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient’s condition is von Willebrand disease, which is a common inherited bleeding disorder that affects the blood’s ability to clot. It is characterized by a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor, a protein that is necessary for platelet adhesion and protection of factor VIII.

The answer is A) Von Willebrand disease.",A,False
"A previously healthy 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden weakness of her right arm and leg that started 3 hours ago. She returned from a business trip from Europe 3 days ago. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 115/min and regular, and blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased muscle strength on the entire right side. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ on the right. Babinski sign is present on the right. The left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?","{'A': 'Patent foramen ovale', 'B': 'Atrial myxoma', 'C': 'Mitral valve vegetation', 'D': 'Atrial fibrillation', 'E': 'Carotid artery dissection'}",A,"The patient presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and signs of deep vein thrombosis (swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg). These findings are suggestive of a thromboembolic event. The most likely source of emboli in this case is a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, which can lead to a pulmonary embolism if it dislodges. This is supported by the presence of risk factors such as smoking, oral contraceptive use, and recent immobilization from a long trip.

Patent foramen ovale (A) is a condition where there is a hole between the left and right atria, but it is not typically associated with thromboembolic events unless there is an additional factor like a clot in the right atrium.

Atrial myxoma (B) is a type of heart tumor that can cause embolic events, but it is less likely in this case without any other supporting evidence such as symptoms of heart failure or a mass seen on imaging.

Mitral valve vegetation (C) is associated with infective endocarditis, which can cause embolic events. However, the patient's presentation is not typical for infective endocarditis, which usually includes a history of fever, heart murmur, and possible blood culture positivity for organisms.

Atrial fibrillation (D) is a common cause of cardioembolic stroke, but the patient's regular pulse makes this less likely, and there is no mention of a history of atrial fibrillation.

Carotid artery dissection (E) can present with neurological deficits, but it is usually associated with a history of trauma or a specific physical examination finding such as a Horner's syndrome or a bruit over the affected artery.

Given the clinical presentation and the risk factors, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a thromboembolic event originating from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, which can lead to a pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the answer is not provided among the options given.",A,True

His vital signs indicate tachycardia with a pulse of 136/min and hypotension with a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear, and there are no cardiac abnormalities on examination. The ECG is not shown, but the clinical presentation suggests that the patient may be experiencing a cardiac event.

Given the patient's irregular and rapid pulse, the most likely diagnosis is a tachyarrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The low blood pressure and chest pain raise concern for hemodynamic instability, which requires immediate intervention.

Option A (Coronary angiogram) is typically indicated for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute tachyarrhythmias.

Option B (Intravenous esmolol) is a beta-blocker that can be used to control heart rate in cases of tachyarrhythmias. It may be appropriate if the patient were hemodynamically stable, but given the patient's hypotension and chest pain, more immediate action is needed.

Option C (Intravenous amiodarone) is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat various tachyarrhythmias. It is often used in the setting of hemodynamic instability, but it has a slower onset of action compared to other options.

Option D (Synchronized cardioversion) is used to convert certain types of tachyarrhythmias to a normal sinus rhythm when the patient is hemodynamically unstable. This option is typically considered when defibrillation is not immediately successful or if the rhythm is not ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.

Option E (Defibrillation) is the immediate treatment of choice for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia",A,False

The fact that he was born prematurely at 29 weeks and is presenting with these symptoms, along with the laboratory finding of elevated chloride concentration in the sweat test, suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This protein functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells and is involved in the regulation of other transport pathways, including the transport of bicarbonate and water. The dysfunction of this protein leads to thick, viscous secretions in various organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. This is consistent with the patient’s symptoms of poor weight gain and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, which can be attributed to malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency. The respiratory symptoms are due to the accumulation of thick secretions in the lungs, leading to recurrent infections. The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture is also a common finding in CF patients. Therefore, the answer is B) Abnormal CFTR protein.",B,True
An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B.

"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?","{'A': '45/195', 'B': '39/400', 'C': '30/400', 'D': '(30/200) / (30/400)', 'E': '30/200'}",A,"The prevalence of alcohol use in the town is 30%, which means 30% of the population are alcoholics. So, out of the total population of 10,000, 30% or 3,000 people are alcoholics.

The incidence of GERD among alcoholics is 30/200, which is 15% (30 out of 200 alcoholics developed GERD).

The incidence of GERD among non-alcoholics is 30/400, which is 7.5% (30 out of 400 non-alcoholics developed GERD).

To find the fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to find the difference in incidence rates between alcoholics and non-alcoholics.

Incidence rate among alcoholics = 15%
Incidence rate among non-alcoholics = 7.5%

Prevention fraction = Incidence rate among alcoholics - Incidence rate among non-alcoholics
Prevention fraction = 15% - 7.5%
Prevention fraction = 7.5%

Now, let's convert this percentage into a fraction:
Prevention fraction = 7.5/100
Prevention fraction = 0.075

Among the 10,000 people in the town, 3,000 are alcoholics, so the number of people who can be prevented from developing GERD if alcohol is no longer consumed is 0.075 * 3,000 = 225 people.

Out of the 225 prevented cases, 30 are already alcoholics, so the remaining cases that can be prevented in the general population (non-alcoholics) are 225 - 30 = 195 people.

Therefore, the answer is A) 45/195.",A,True

Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione', 'B': 'Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen', 'C': 'Point mutation in β-globin', 'D': 'Deficiency of ATP', 'E': 'Osmotically fragile erythrocytes'}",D,"The newborn's symptoms of fever, jaundice, decreased flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis, along with laboratory findings of decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels, suggest a hemolytic process. The presence of yellow discoloration of the skin and sclerae indicates jaundice, which is a common manifestation of hemolysis. The photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear would likely show signs of hemolysis, such as schistocytes or spherocytes, if a microangiopathic process were involved, or spherocytes if hereditary spherocytosis were the cause.

The options provided are potential causes of hemolysis. Let's evaluate each one:

A) Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione: This would be more consistent with oxidative stress on the red blood cells, which can lead to hemolysis, but it is not the most likely cause in this scenario.

B) Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen: This is a common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), also known as erythroblastosis fetalis. When an Rh-negative mother is sensitized to Rh-positive fetal blood cells, she can produce antibodies that cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the fetus.

C) Point mutation in β-globin: This would be indicative of a hemoglobinopathy, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia. However, these conditions typically do not present with symptoms immediately after birth.

D) Deficiency of ATP: A deficiency of ATP can lead to impaired red blood cell function and hemolysis, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.

E) Osmotically fragile erythrocytes: This is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition where red blood cells are more fragile due to a defect in the cell membrane. While this could explain the hemolysis, it does not account for the maternal-fetal antibody reaction that is suggested by the history and presentation.

These symptoms are suggestive of myasthenia gravis, which is associated with thymomas. The CT scan of the chest shows an anterior mediastinal mass, which is consistent with a thymoma. The photomicrograph of the specimen from the mass would likely show thymic tissue.

The immunologic processes that occur in the thymus include thymocyte formation and negative selection. Thymocyte formation refers to the development of T lymphocytes (thymocytes) in the thymus. Negative selection is a process that occurs in the thymus, where T cells that react strongly to self-antigens are induced to undergo apoptosis, preventing autoimmunity.

B-cell maturation (option A) occurs in the bone marrow. Macrophage activation (option B) is a process that can occur in various tissues, but it is not specific to the thymus. V(D)J recombination (option C) is the process of somatic recombination that generates the diverse array of antibodies and T-cell receptors, which occurs in developing B and T cells, but it is not specific to the thymus.

Given the location of the mass in the anterior mediastinum and the associated clinical picture, the immunologic process that normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow in the photomicrograph would most likely be related to thymocyte development or negative selection. Since thymocyte formation is a broader process that includes the development and maturation of T cells within the thymus, the most appropriate answer is thymocyte formation.

The patient has been started on intravenous fluids, dopamine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have improved his blood pressure. The next step in management should focus on addressing the likely source of infection, which in this case is the dilated common bile duct.

ERCP (A) is the procedure of choice for both diagnosing and treating conditions of the bile duct, such as cholangitis or bile duct stones. It allows for direct visualization of the bile duct and the opportunity to perform interventions, such as removing stones or placing stents, if necessary.

Close monitoring (B) is important but not the best next step given the likely diagnosis and the need for immediate intervention.

MRCP (C) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed images of the bile ducts and may be useful in certain situations. However, given the patient's acute presentation and the need for immediate intervention, ERCP is more appropriate.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (D) is an invasive procedure typically used when ERCP is not possible or has failed. It is not the first-line approach in this scenario.

CT abdomen (E) can provide additional information about the abdominal organs and structures but is not the most appropriate next step in the management of suspected cholangitis with a dilated common bile duct.

Therefore, the answer is A) ERCP.",A,True
"A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days. He smokes 2 packs per day and drinks 2–3 beers every day. He denies any previous medical problems except for seasonal allergies for which he takes diphenhydramine on occasions. At the hospital, the vital signs include: temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered.

The vital signs indicate a high fever and increased respiratory rate. The physical exam findings of small scars in the decubitus region, bilateral crackles in the lungs, a systolic murmur radiating to the left axilla, and petechiae on the hard palate and palms suggest an infectious process. The presence of petechiae, in particular, may indicate endocarditis. The patient's history of intravenous drug use (implied by the small scars in the decubitus region) is a risk factor for infective endocarditis.

Given the clinical presentation and risk factors, the most likely organism causing his symptoms would be one commonly associated with infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of infective endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users. Therefore, the answer is C) Staphylococcus aureus.",C,True
"A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta.

The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, where the uterus fails to contract adequately after delivery. The initial management of PPH due to uterine atony involves the administration of uterotonic drugs to stimulate uterine contractions. Intravenous oxytocin is the first-line medication for this purpose. Therefore, the best next step in management is to administer intravenous oxytocin to encourage uterine contraction and reduce bleeding. The answer is C) Intravenous oxytocin.",C,False

Among the medications listed, lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is known to cause a persistent dry cough in some patients. The next step in management would be to change the medication causing the cough. Changing the antidepressant (citalopram to escitalopram) would not address the cough. Similarly, changing the statin (atorvastatin to lovastatin) would not be indicated in this scenario. Beta-blockers like propranolol are not indicated for hypertension in this patient and could potentially worsen asthma control. Therefore, the best option would be to change the ACE inhibitor to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) like losartan, which is less likely to cause a cough. Therefore, the answer is E) Change lisinopril to losartan.",E,True
A 3-year-old male is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences.

"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?","{'A': 'Patent processus vaginalis', 'B': 'Dilation of the pampiniform plexus', 'C': 'Twisting of the spermatic cord', 'D': 'Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis', 'E': 'Impaired lymphatic drainage'}",D,"The patient presents with a painless, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing, and normal tissue can be palpated above the mass. These findings suggest that the mass is not related to the testis itself but is likely a scrotal mass. The absence of bowel sounds in the mass and its failure to reduce when the patient is supine makes intestinal herniation less likely.

Option A, Patent processus vaginalis, is a condition that can lead to a communicating hydrocele or an inguinal hernia, but a patent processus vaginalis typically allows abdominal contents to herniate into the scrotum, which would likely produce a cough impulse and could potentially reduce when the patient is supine.

Option B, Dilation of the pampiniform plexus, refers to a condition where dilated veins in the spermatic cord cause a mass that can be felt in the scrotum. However, this condition is typically associated with pain and would not transilluminate.

Option C, Twisting of the spermatic cord, also known as testicular torsion, presents with acute, severe pain and would not produce a transilluminating mass.

Option D, Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, describes the pathophysiology of a noncommunicating hydrocele. This condition can lead to the accumulation of fluid within the tunica vaginalis, resulting in a cystic mass that transilluminates and is not associated with the testis itself.

Option E, Impaired lymphatic drainage, would more likely result in a scrotal edema or hydrocele, but this would not typically present as a cystic mass that transilluminates.

Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which is consistent with a noncommunicating hydrocele. Therefore, the answer is D) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.",A,False
"A patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her head. She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms.

Between the options provided, both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes can present with acute neurological deficits. However, given the patient's history of taking sumatriptan and naproxen, which can increase the risk of vascular events, and the fact that she has not responded to dihydroergotamine and IV fluids, an ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus is more likely than a hemorrhagic stroke. Medication reaction and psychogenic symptoms are less likely to cause focal neurological deficits. Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a sudden onset ""thunderclap"" headache, but would not typically cause unilateral weakness and speech difficulties without significant changes in consciousness. Therefore, the answer is B) Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus.",B,False

The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, which indicates active labor, and she is 70% effaced with a -2 station of the fetal head. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities.

Given her history of preterm delivery and the current status of her cervix, it is important to consider the risks of preterm birth and the potential for neonatal complications. The options provided are:

A) Allow vaginal delivery
B) Initiate misoprostol therapy
C) Initiate nifedipine therapy
D) Perform cesarean delivery
E) Perform dilation and evacuation

Misoprostol (option B) and nifedipine (option C) are medications used for cervical ripening and tocolysis, respectively. These options are typically considered when an earlier delivery is desired or when preterm labor is being managed to allow for fetal maturation. However, given the patient's active labor and the risks associated with preterm birth, these options may not be the most appropriate.

Dilation and evacuation (option E) is a method of inducing a medical abortion and is not appropriate in this case as the patient is not seeking termination of pregnancy.

Considering the patient's history and the current status of her labor, the most appropriate next step in management would be to prepare for delivery, given the risks associated with preterm birth and the fact that the patient is already in active labor.

The normal serum osmolality is typically between 275 and 295 mOsmol/kg H2O, and the patient's osmolality is 300 mOsmol/kg H2O, which indicates a state of hypernatremia.

The urine osmolality is 240 mOsmol/kg H2O, which is inappropriately low given the high serum osmolality. This suggests that the kidneys are not concentrating urine as they should in response to the high serum osmolality.

The most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia is decreased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH is responsible for water reabsorption in the kidneys, and a decrease in its secretion would lead to diluted urine and dehydration, resulting in hypernatremia.

Therefore, the answer is D) Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion.",D,True
"A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit.

The tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox and decreased grip strength are classic signs. However, the negative Finkelstein's test and the absence of abnormalities on the initial x-ray do not rule out a scaphoid fracture, as these can sometimes be occult (not visible) on initial imaging.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to immobilize the wrist and repeat the x-rays in 2 weeks, as scaphoid fractures can often become apparent on x-rays after some time has passed (as the bone may become more visible due to resorption of the surrounding bone or callus formation). This approach allows for the possibility of a fracture while avoiding the risks associated with more invasive procedures like surgery or corticosteroid injections, which are not indicated in this scenario.

Therefore, the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind in this case is the hemidesmosomes. The answer is D) Hemidesmosomes.",D,True
"A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis. He feels increasingly anxious during physical education (PE) class as he has noticed that the size of his penis is significantly smaller when compared to his peers. Based on the physical examination, he is Tanner stage 1. The weight and height are 60 kg (132 lb) and 175 cm (5 ft 9 in), respectively. The cardiopulmonary examination is normal; however, the patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder?","{'A': 'Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat', 'B': 'Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency', 'C': 'Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting', 'D': 'Leptin receptor mutation', 'E': 'Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes'}",B,"The patient is a 17-year-old man who is concerned about the size of his penis and is Tanner stage 1, indicating a lack of pubertal development. His weight and height are within normal ranges for his age. The patient also has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell, which suggests a sensory deficit. The combination of delayed puberty and anosmia (loss of sense of smell) is characteristic of Kallmann syndrome, a condition caused by a deficiency in the production or function of GnRH. This condition is often due to a deletion or mutation affecting the KAL1 gene, which is responsible for the transport of GnRH-secreting neurons during embryonic development. The pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder is therefore isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency. The answer is B) Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency.",B,True
"A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history. Vitals show a temperature of 37-0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?","{'A': 'Immediate cardiac transplant', 'B': 'Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated', 'C': 'Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets', 'D': 'Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space', 'E': 'Surgical adhesive glue'}",C,"The patient presents with a penetrating chest trauma with evidence of cardiac injury. The right ventricular free wall has been penetrated, but there are no injuries to the coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension and tachycardia, indicating ongoing bleeding and possible cardiac tamponade.

Option A, Immediate cardiac transplant, is not the best definitive surgical approach in this scenario. Cardiac transplant is a complex procedure reserved for end-stage heart disease or irreparable damage, which is not clearly the case here.

Option B, Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated, is not appropriate as the patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires immediate surgical intervention.

Option C, Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets, is a technique used for repairing cardiac lacerations. This option seems appropriate as it addresses the need for surgical repair of the cardiac injury.

Option D, Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space, is performed to relieve a tension pneumothorax, which is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of pneumothorax.

Option E, Surgical adhesive glue, is used for sealing small defects in the heart but may not be suitable for a full-thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall.

Considering the information provided, the best definitive surgical approach would be to repair the cardiac laceration using an interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets. Therefore, the answer is C) Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets.",A,False
"A 6-year-old Russian boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents to your office with fever and dyspnea.

Therefore, the answer is B) Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation.",B,True
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?","{'A': 'Diabetic polyuria', 'B': 'Overactive detrusor muscle', 'C': 'Primary polydipsia', 'D': 'Urethral hypermobility', 'E': 'Vescicovaginal fistula'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of urinary leakage during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., laughing, coughing) and the fact that she has to go to the bathroom frequently to prevent ""wetting myself"" suggest stress urinary incontinence. This is often due to urethral hypermobility, which can be a result of weakened pelvic floor muscles, possibly related to her history of vaginal delivery and cesarean section. Diabetic polyuria is unlikely without other symptoms of diabetes. Overactive detrusor muscle typically presents with urgency and frequency without leakage during stress activities. Primary polydipsia would not explain the incontinence and is unlikely given her normal specific gravity. A vescicovaginal fistula would likely present with continuous leakage of urine into the vagina and would not be limited to stress incontinence. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms is D) Urethral hypermobility.",D,True
"A 52-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia comes to the emergency department 30 minutes after the sudden onset of substernal chest pain while sitting in a chair at home. He reports drinking 2 glasses of whiskey earlier that day, after a stressful day at work. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. His pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds. An ECG obtained on arrival at the emergency department shows ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. 15 minutes later, the patient's chest pain has resolved and a repeat ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s chest pain?","{'A': 'Coronary artery vasospasm', 'B': 'Coronary artery vasodilation', 'C': 'Atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing', 'D': 'Atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'E': 'Pericardial inflammation'}",A,"The patient's presentation is consistent with unstable angina or a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which is typically caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation leading to coronary artery occlusion. The ST-segment elevations seen on the initial ECG suggest an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but they resolve on the repeat ECG, which is more consistent with unstable angina rather than a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). Coronary artery vasospasm is less likely given the patient's risk factors and the resolution of symptoms and ECG changes. Coronary artery vasodilation is not a cause of chest pain. Pericardial inflammation would not typically present with ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads and would more likely cause diffuse ST-segment elevations or PR depressions. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is D) Atherosclerotic plaque rupture.",E,False
A scientist observes a myocyte beating in cell culture. Which step is the most direct necessary component of relaxation for this cell?,"{'A': 'Influx of sodium ions', 'B': 'Efflux of potassium ions', 'C': 'Influx of calcium ions from the sacroplasmic reticulum', 'D': 'Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte', 'E': 'Efflux of calcium ions'}",E,"The process of muscle relaxation involves the reduction of intracellular calcium levels. Calcium ions are essential for muscle contraction. Therefore, for relaxation to occur, calcium ions must leave the cell.

The rough, erythematous skin patches over her elbows, which have been present for the last few months, are indicative of psoriasis. The stiffness and swelling of her right knee for the past 6 weeks, along with the family history of a similar condition, further support the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in some people with psoriasis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C) Psoriatic arthritis.",C,True
"A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with continued hypertension despite adherence to multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels and wants to initiate a trial of an aldosterone receptor antagonist.

His past medical history is significant for well-controlled schizophrenia, and he is on a low-potency typical antipsychotic medication. Typical antipsychotics are known to cause ocular side effects, including pseudomaturation of the lens (pseudophakia), which can lead to blurred vision and glare. However, the patient's condition does not seem to be an emergency, and there is no mention of any acute or ophthalmologic emergency in the scenario.

The best first step in managing this patient's symptoms would be to refer him to an ophthalmologist (Option D). The ophthalmologist can perform a comprehensive eye examination to determine the exact cause of the vision impairment and provide appropriate treatment or management options. Reassurance (Option B) may not be appropriate without further evaluation, and decreasing medication dosage (Option A) may not be necessary or beneficial without an understanding of the specific ocular pathology involved. An ocular examination under anesthesia (Option C) or a slit-lamp examination (Option E) may be part of the comprehensive eye examination but are not the best first steps before referring the patient to an ophthalmologist.

Therefore, the answer is D) Refer to ophthalmologist.",A,False

"An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?","{'A': '30%', 'B': '15%', 'C': '95%', 'D': '99%', 'E': '5%'}",B,"The question is asking for the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL given that the mean concentration is 17 g/dL and the standard error is 0.1 g/dL. This is a problem in the tail of a normal distribution.

Since the mean is 17 g/dL, 18 g/dL is exactly 1 standard deviation above the mean. In a normal distribution, approximately 27% of the data falls more than 1 standard deviation above the mean.

However, since the standard error is given as 0.1 g/dL, we need to convert this to standard deviations. Since 1 standard deviation is 0.1 g/dL, 18 g/dL would be 18/0.1 = 180 standard deviations above the mean.

The area to the right of the mean plus 180 standard deviations is extremely small and is not a standard probability value. However, we can approximate it by looking at the area to the right of 16 standard deviations, which is approximately 0.00000001 or 0.000001% (1 in 1,000,000).

Since 180 standard deviations is much greater than 16 standard deviations, the probability of having a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is less than 0.000001%.

The closest answer choice to 0.000001% is E) 5%. Therefore, the answer is E) 5%.",E,False

ARF is a nonsuppurative sequela of pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus. One of the major criteria for the diagnosis of ARF is the presence of migratory polyarthritis involving large joints. Other major criteria include carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea. Minor criteria include fever, arthralgia, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP), and prolonged PR interval on ECG.

Among the options provided, the symptom most likely to be present in a patient with ARF is Sydenham chorea (C), which is a manifestation of the disease caused by streptococcal infection affecting the basal ganglia of the brain. Renal failure (A) and hepatomegaly (B) are not typically associated with ARF. Pleural effusion (D) can be seen in rheumatic heart disease, which is a complication of ARF, but it is not a direct manifestation of ARF itself. A butterfly rash (E) is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not ARF.

The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?","{'A': 'Glycopyrrolate', 'B': 'Benztropine', 'C': 'Levodopa', 'D': 'Dantrolene', 'E': 'Propranolol'}",B,"The patient presents with neck stiffness, specifically neck flexion and rotation to the right, along with firm and contracted right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. These symptoms are suggestive of acute dystonia, which is a type of extrapyramidal side effect. The patient's history of schizophrenia and the fact that he took more medication because he was hearing voices suggest that he may have taken an increased dose of antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol or risperidone, can cause acute dystonia as a side effect.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate treatment for acute dystonia is benztropine (Option B), which is an anticholinergic medication used to manage extrapyramidal side effects caused by antipsychotic drugs. Glycopyrrolate (Option A) is also an anticholinergic, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute dystonia. Levodopa (Option C) is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and is not indicated for acute dystonia. Dantrolene (Option D) is used to treat malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, not acute dystonia. Propranolol (Option E) is a beta-blocker and is not used to treat extrapyramidal side effects.

For the past 1 week, the child has been experiencing thick purulent cough and says that her chest feels ‘heavy’. Her stools have been loose and foul-smelling over the past week. Her parents are also concerned that she has not gained much weight due to her frequent hospital visits. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, the temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). She appears lethargic and uncomfortable. Crackles are heard in the lower lung bases, with dullness to percussion. A small nasal polyp is also present on inspection. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the girl’s symptoms?","{'A': 'Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator', 'B': 'Inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine', 'C': 'Dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia', 'D': 'Acute hypersensitivity changes and bronchospasm', 'E': 'Deficiency in lymphocytic activity'}",A,"The child's symptoms of persistent cough, fever, and vomiting, along with a history of multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia, suggest a chronic condition affecting the respiratory system. The presence of thick purulent cough, chest heaviness, and crackles in the lower lung bases with dullness to percussion indicates a possible chronic lung disease with infection. The loose and foul-smelling stools could be a result of malabsorption secondary to the chronic illness. The child's failure to thrive (not gaining much weight) further supports the presence of a chronic condition. The presence of a small nasal polyp may indicate an underlying inflammatory process.

Option A, dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator, is not specific to the symptoms described and is more commonly associated with conditions like cystic fibrosis, which would typically present with more gastrointestinal symptoms and failure to thrive from birth.

Option B, inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, refers to a metabolic disorder like maple syrup urine disease, which presents with neurological symptoms and a characteristic maple syrup odor in the urine, not primarily with respiratory symptoms.

Option C, dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia, is a likely cause for the symptoms. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, nasal polyps, and gastrointestinal issues due to the impaired movement of cilia in the respiratory tract, leading to poor mucus clearance.

Option D, acute hypersensitivity changes and bronchospasm, would be more indicative of asthma or allergic reactions, which typically do not cause foul-smelling stools or failure to thrive.

Option E, deficiency in lymphocytic activity, suggests an immunodeficiency disorder. While this could explain the recurrent infections, it does not account for the nasal polyp or the gastrointestinal symptoms.

Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the girl's symptoms is a dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia, which is consistent with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Therefore, the answer is C) Dysfunction",A,True

"A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:

The laboratory test results confirm this with a serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL, which is below the normal range (8.5-10.2 mg/dL). The patient's recent total thyroidectomy is a significant clue. The parathyroid glands, which are responsible for calcium homeostasis, can be inadvertently removed or damaged during thyroid surgery, leading to hypoparathyroidism and subsequent hypocalcemia. This is a common complication of thyroidectomy. Congenital absence of parathyroid glands (B) and DiGeorge syndrome (C) are less likely because the patient has no significant medical history suggestive of these conditions. Chronic hypomagnesemia (D) can cause hypocalcemia, but there is no evidence of low magnesium in this patient's laboratory results. Hungry bone syndrome (E) is a condition that occurs after the administration of large doses of calcium chelating agents, which is not applicable here. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is inadvertent surgical removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy.",C,False

The fluctuating nature of her symptoms, which worsen with exposure to heat (e.g., outside in the summer), and the absence of abdominal reflexes may point towards a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, often affecting young adults.

Given the clinical presentation and the need to evaluate for central nervous system lesions, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be imaging of the brain and spine. An MRI is the preferred modality for visualizing demyelinating plaques in MS.

Therefore, the answer is D) MRI of the brain and spine.",D,True
"A 2-year-old girl is brought in to the office by her parents. They state that their daughter has recently been more irritable than usual, and she occasionally becomes pale and blue. Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'B': 'Transposition of great vessels', 'C': 'Pulmonary hypoplasia', 'D': 'Atrial septal defect', 'E': 'Patent ductus arteriosus'}",A,"The child's symptoms of irritability and occasional paleness and cyanosis suggest a congenital heart defect that causes periods of decreased blood flow to the body (cyanotic episodes). The harsh, systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border is consistent with a defect that causes increased blood flow through the right heart and pulmonary artery.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is A) Tetralogy of Fallot. This congenital heart defect includes four abnormalities: a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The combination of these defects leads to the clinical picture described in the question.",A,True
A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?,"{'A': 'Shoulder abduction', 'B': 'Elbow flexion', 'C': 'Forearm pronation', 'D': 'Index finger flexion', 'E': 'Wrist extension'}",B,"The patient's symptoms of tingling in the right forearm and loss of sensation on the lateral side of the forearm, with intact sensation over the thumb, suggest involvement of the radial nerve. The radial nerve innervates the muscles responsible for wrist extension. Therefore, further examination is most likely to show weakness of wrist extension. The answer is E) Wrist extension.",E,False
"A 16-year-old female patient with a history of mental retardation presents to your clinic with her mother. The mother states that she wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation after she recently discovered her looking at pornographic materials. She states that her daughter is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, and that she does not want her to be burdened with a child that she would not be able to raise. Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?","{'A': 'Schedule the patient for the requested surgery', 'B': 'Wait until the patient is 18 years old, and then schedule for surgery', 'C': 'Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy', 'D': 'Refer the patient to a psychiatrist to get informed consent', 'E': 'Refuse the procedure because it is unlikely that the patient will get pregnant'}",C,"The patient is a minor, and the mother is requesting a procedure that will permanently alter the patient's reproductive capabilities. The mother's request is based on the belief that the patient is not capable of understanding the consequences of sexual intercourse. However, the patient's inability to understand the repercussions of sexual intercourse does not automatically grant permission for the mother to make this decision on her behalf. The patient's autonomy and best interests must be considered.

Option C, which refers to the ethical principle of autonomy, is the most appropriate choice. Autonomy means that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. In this case, the patient is a minor, but her autonomy should still be respected as much as possible. The patient should be involved in the decision-making process, and her wishes and understanding should be taken into account.

Therefore, the answer is C) Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy.",C,True
"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?","{'A': 'Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder', 'B': 'Ultrasound the surgical site', 'C': 'Aggressive IV fluids', 'D': 'Digital rectal exam', 'E': 'Renal ultrasound'}",A,"The patient has not passed urine since the surgery, which was 14 hours ago. The lack of urine output is concerning for urinary retention, which is a common postoperative complication, especially in older men. The bladder scan is inconclusive due to the patient's obesity, which is a common issue in obese patients. The next best step in managing urinary retention is to relieve the retention and empty the bladder. The most direct and appropriate method to do this is to insert a urinary catheter. Therefore, the answer is A) Insert a 'straight cath' into the patient's bladder.",A,True
"A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Serum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L
An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?","{'A': 'Antinuclear antibody', 'B': 'Hepatitis C virus antibodies', 'C': 'JAK-2 mutation', 'D': 'Peripheral blood flow cytometry', 'E': 'Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test'}",B,"The patient's presentation of painless lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and a history of HIV with noncompliance to antiretroviral therapy is highly suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder, most likely lymphoma. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the presence of systemic symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight loss) further support this. The histopathologic analysis of the lymph node biopsy confirms the likely diagnosis of lymphoma.

The next best diagnostic step in the workup of a patient with confirmed lymphoma is to determine the specific subtype of lymphoma, which will guide treatment decisions. This is typically done through immunophenotyping and/or molecular genetic studies of the lymph node tissue.

Option D, Peripheral blood flow cytometry, is the most appropriate next step as it will allow for the analysis of cell surface markers on the lymphocytes, which is essential for classifying the lymphoma (e.g., determining if it is of B-cell or T-cell origin, and whether it is a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

Therefore, the answer is D) Peripheral blood flow cytometry.",D,False
A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. He feels solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum when he eats. Drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing. He has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. He has no hoarseness or weight loss. He has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole. His past medical history is also significant for asthma and eczema. He takes no medications except for omeprazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following best explains these findings?,"{'A': 'Achalasia', 'B': 'Diffuse esophageal spasm', 'C': 'Eosinophilic esophagitis', 'D': 'Esophageal reflux disease', 'E': 'Schatzki’s ring'}",C,"The patient has difficulty swallowing solid food that gets stuck in his chest behind the sternum, which is a symptom of dysphagia. The absence of coughing or nasal regurgitation and the fact that drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing suggest that the problem is not related to a global esophageal motility disorder. The lack of hoarseness and weight loss makes malignancy less likely. The patient has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). His past medical history of asthma and eczema, along with the lack of response to potent acid suppression, raises the possibility of an atopic condition.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic esophagitis (C), which is an allergic condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus. It is associated with other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema. The symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis often include dysphagia for solids, food impaction, and heartburn, which are consistent with the patient’s presentation. The lack of response to potent acid suppression also supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the answer is C) Eosinophilic esophagitis.",C,True
"A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department from his home complaining of dyspnea. He is alert and oriented. The following arterial blood gas readings are drawn: pH: 7.33 (Normal: 7.35-7.45), pCO2: 70 mmHg (Normal: 35-45 mmHg), HCO3 33 (Normal: 21-26 mEq/L) Which of the following is most likely to have produced this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Panic attack', 'B': 'Mechanical ventilation', 'C': 'Diabetic ketoacidosis', 'D': 'Pulmonary embolus', 'E': 'Chronic obstructive bronchitis'}",E,"The patient's arterial blood gas readings show a pH of 7.33, which is below the normal range, indicating acidemia. The pCO2 is 70 mmHg, which is above the normal range, indicating respiratory acidosis. The HCO3 is 33 mEq/L, which is above the normal range, suggesting a compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

Given these findings, we can rule out panic attack (A) and diabetic ketoacidosis (C) because they typically present with a metabolic acidosis, not respiratory acidosis. Mechanical ventilation (B) can cause respiratory acidosis if it leads to hypercapnia, but there is no information suggesting that the patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Pulmonary embolus (D) can cause acute respiratory failure and result in respiratory acidosis, but it is less likely to cause chronic elevations in pCO2 unless the patient has underlying chronic lung disease.

Chronic obstructive bronchitis (E) is a chronic lung disease that can lead to chronic respiratory acidosis due to long-term retention of CO2. The elevated HCO3 suggests that the body has been compensating for the respiratory acidosis over time.

Therefore, the answer is E) Chronic obstructive bronchitis.",E,True
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of painful ulcers in her mouth. Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 μm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?","{'A': 'Deficient heme synthesis', 'B': 'Deficient DNA crosslink repair', 'C': 'Deficient erythropoietin secretion', 'D': 'Deficient nitrogenous base production', 'E': 'Deficient β-globin chains'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, difficulties concentrating, pallor, and mouth ulcers, along with the laboratory findings of a low hemoglobin concentration, high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hypersegmented neutrophils, are suggestive of megaloblastic anemia. This type of anemia is often caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate. Since the patient was started on a new medication 4 months ago, it is possible that this medication is interfering with the absorption of vitamin B12 or folate, leading to the deficiency.

Option B (Deficient DNA crosslink repair) refers to a defect in the repair of DNA crosslinks, which is associated with diseases like Fanconi anemia, not megaloblastic anemia.

Option C (Deficient erythropoietin secretion) would lead to a decrease in red blood cell production, but it would not explain the high MCV or hypersegmented neutrophils.

Option D (Deficient nitrogenous base production) is not a recognized cause of megaloblastic anemia.

Option E (Deficient β-globin chains) refers to a defect in hemoglobin synthesis, such as in beta-thalassemia, which would cause a microcytic anemia, not a macrocytic anemia like the one seen in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is a deficiency in the production of vitamin B12 or folate, which is required for proper DNA synthesis in red blood cells. The answer is A) Deficient heme synthesis.",A,False
"A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as ""a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)–diffuse large B cell variant"".

Among the listed risk factors, previous radiation therapy is known to be associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies, including lymphomas. Therefore, the answer is C) Previous radiation therapy.",C,True
"A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?","{'A': 'Acanthosis nigricans', 'B': 'Cholelithiasis', 'C': 'Decreased vitamin D absorption', 'D': 'Hepatotoxicity', 'E': 'Teratogenicity'}",B,"The patient has a history of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. The drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and decrease in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is likely a fibrate. Fibrates are known to cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, muscle pain, and most notably, they can increase the risk of cholelithiasis (gallstones). Therefore, the answer is B) Cholelithiasis.",B,True
"A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?","{'A': 'Supraspinatus', 'B': 'Infraspinatus', 'C': 'Teres minor', 'D': 'Subscapularis', 'E': 'Deltoid'}",A,"The patient's symptoms of pain and weakness in the right shoulder, particularly with external rotation, and the fact that lifting weights exacerbated his symptoms, suggest a rotator cuff injury. The patient's inability to slowly lower his arm (a positive ""drop arm"" sign) and significant weakness in abduction (1/5 strength) further support this. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Among these, the supraspinatus is primarily responsible for the initial 15 degrees of arm abduction. Given the patient's weakness in abduction and the positive drop arm sign, the most likely injured muscle is the supraspinatus. Therefore, the answer is A) Supraspinatus.",A,True
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient’s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
Leukocyte esterase  positive
WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF
Nitrites positive
RBCs 2 cell/HPF
Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF
Urine pH 5.7
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?","{'A': 'TMP-SMX', 'B': 'Nitrofurantoin', 'C': 'Levofloxacin', 'D': 'Cephalexin', 'E': 'No treatment is necessary'}",E,"The patient has a history of Alzheimer’s dementia and is currently experiencing difficulty locating objects, which could be a progression of her dementia. The physical exam findings of a holosystolic murmur, S3 gallop, and mild crackles at the lung bases are consistent with her history of congestive heart failure. The urinalysis findings of leukocyte esterase, WBCs, and nitrites are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The growth of Enterobacter in a previous urine culture indicates that she may have a resistant organism.

Given the patient’s history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism, it is important to choose an antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter and safe for her other medical conditions. TMP-SMX (A) is not the best choice due to the risk of adverse effects in patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease. Nitrofurantoin (B) is generally avoided in patients with significant kidney impairment, which can be present in patients with diabetes and congestive heart failure. Levofloxacin (C) is a fluoroquinolone and may have risks in patients with osteoarthritis. Cephalexin (D) is a cephalosporin and is not typically effective against Enterobacter.

Considering the patient’s medical history and the need for an antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter, the most appropriate choice would be to treat the UTI with an antibiotic that covers resistant organisms and is safe for her other conditions. Therefore, the answer is E) No treatment is necessary.",E,True
A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months. She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?,"{'A': 'Pelvic inflammatory disease', 'B': ""Asherman's syndrome"", 'C': 'Diminished ovarian reserve', 'D': 'Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism', 'E': 'Premature ovarian failure'}",C,"The patient is a 35-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for over a year without success. She has had one unsuccessful attempt at in vitro fertilization. Her husband's semen analysis is normal. She has a history of a previous uncomplicated pregnancy and regular menstrual cycles. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Given this information, the most likely cause of her infertility is related to her age, as women in their late 30s have a decreased ovarian reserve compared to younger women. This decreased ovarian reserve can lead to difficulties in conceiving. The answer is C) Diminished ovarian reserve.",C,True
"A 6-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a wellness examination. The mother reports that her child has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported. The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared ""normal"" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","{'A': 'Anterior horn cell degeneration', 'B': 'Axonal demyelination', 'C': 'Decreased acetylcholine receptor density', 'D': 'Impaired acetylcholine release', 'E': 'Myonecrosis'}",A,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a neuromuscular disorder. The fact that he has difficulty with motor milestones such as rolling over and sitting unsupported, but has normal extraocular movements and a symmetric smile, suggests that the issue is not with his central nervous system (CNS) but rather with the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or neuromuscular junction. The weak cry and suck further support a problem with the neuromuscular function.

The presence of symmetric flaccid weakness, a bell-shaped chest, and diminished deep tendon reflexes are characteristic of a condition called infantile botulism, which is caused by impaired acetylcholine release due to a toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. This toxin prevents the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and flaccidity.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is D) Impaired acetylcholine release.",C,False
"A 48-year-old homeless male is brought to the emergency department, by the police, for altered mental status. Past medical records are unavailable. A physical exam on admission reveals scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists during extension. The patient is admitted to the hospital and his treatment is started after appropriate investigation. The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely receive after admission?","{'A': 'Thiamine', 'B': 'Lactulose', 'C': 'Naloxone', 'D': 'Loperamide', 'E': 'Rifaximin'}",B,"The patient's presentation of altered mental status, scleral icterus, flapping tremor of the wrists (asterixis), and improvement after admission suggests hepatic encephalopathy, likely secondary to alcoholic liver disease or another form of chronic liver disease. The treatment for hepatic encephalopathy often includes the reduction of ammonia production and absorption in the intestines.

Among the options provided:

A) Thiamine is used to treat or prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is associated with thiamine deficiency, commonly seen in alcoholics. While this patient may eventually need thiamine, it is not the primary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.

B) Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It works by acidifying the contents of the bowel, converting ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+), which is then excreted. It also acts as an osmotic laxative, which can explain the patient's diarrhea and flatulence.

C) Naloxone is an opioid antagonist and would be used in cases of opioid overdose, which does not fit this patient's presentation.

D) Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal medication, which would not be used to treat hepatic encephalopathy and would not explain the improvement in mental status or resolution of asterixis.

E) Rifaximin is an antibiotic that can be used to reduce the production of ammonia by intestinal bacteria in hepatic encephalopathy. However, it is less commonly used than lactulose and is not typically the first-line treatment.

Given the patient's symptoms and the common treatments for hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose is the most likely medication to have been administered, as it would explain both the improvement in mental status and the gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, the answer is B) Lactulose.",B,True
"A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating. He also complains of a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months. He is a bodybuilding competitor and has a competition coming up in 1 week. The man reports that his symptoms appeared suddenly, 30 minutes after he took 2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills instead of the 1 he usually takes. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 137/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, and temperature is 39.9°C (103.8°F). Physical examination reveals a reddish maculopapular rash over the patient’s trunk, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in his abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component. Ophthalmologic examination shows bilateral cataracts. The patient’s total blood count is as follows:

Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'The patient’s symptoms are caused by an increased concentration of epinephrine released by the adrenal glands in response to the consumed substance.', 'B': 'The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.', 'C': 'The patient has a pyretic reaction due to bacterial contamination of the pills.', 'D': 'The patient’s condition is due to a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction triggered by the drug.', 'E': 'The drug has stimulated the hypothalamic temperature center to produce hyperthermia.'}",B,"The patient’s symptoms, including fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, profuse sweating, and a decrease in vision, are consistent with sympathomimetic toxicity. This is likely due to the ingestion of fat-burning pills, which often contain sympathomimetic agents such as epinephrine or norepinephrine. These agents can cause an increased concentration of epinephrine released by the adrenal glands in response to the consumed substance. The symptoms of sympathomimetic toxicity, such as hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and rash, align with this mechanism. Therefore, the answer is A) The patient’s symptoms are caused by an increased concentration of epinephrine released by the adrenal glands in response to the consumed substance.",A,False
"A 67-year-old male comes into the ED complaining of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest. He reports that over the past month he has become more easily “winded"" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can’t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:

Volume: 30 cc of fluid
Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL
Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L

Which of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?","{'A': 'Congestive heart failure', 'B': 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'C': 'Liver cirrhosis', 'D': 'Lymphoma', 'E': 'Nephrotic syndrome'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest, along with the physical exam findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right, suggest the presence of a pleural effusion. The chest radiograph confirms this. To determine the cause of the pleural effusion, we can analyze the pleural fluid.

The pleural fluid analysis shows a protein content of 5.8 g/dL, which is higher than the serum protein ratio of 7.0 g/dL. This indicates an exudative effusion rather than a transudative one. Additionally, the LDH level is 258 U/L, which is elevated and also suggests an exudative effusion.

Exudative pleural effusions can be caused by various conditions, including congestive heart failure (CHF), hypoalbuminemia, liver cirrhosis, lymphoma, and nephrotic syndrome. However, given the patient's symptoms of headaches and fatigue, along with the exudative nature of the effusion, the most likely cause is congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure in the blood vessels, causing fluid to leak into the pleural space.

Therefore, the answer is A) Congestive heart failure.",A,False
"A pediatrician notices that 9 of her patients this year have developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. They range in age from 7 to 11, and most of them had no abnormal activities prior to developing the paralysis. These patients concern her because she has not seen this type of paralytic illness in over 20 years of practice. Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?","{'A': 'Different interventions with 2 or more variables can be studied', 'B': 'Hypothesis testing cannot be performed', 'C': 'It should be reported in terms of odds ratio', 'D': 'It should be reported in terms of relative risk', 'E': 'Participants act as their own controls'}",B,"The pediatrician is observing a group of patients who have developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. She has not seen this type of illness in a long time, which suggests that it might be a rare occurrence. The study described here is likely an observational study because the pediatrician is not intervening or manipulating any variables but is rather observing the natural course of the disease in a group of patients.

Option A suggests different interventions with 2 or more variables can be studied, but in this case, the pediatrician is not intervening, so this is not correct.

Option B states that hypothesis testing cannot be performed, which is not true. Even in observational studies, hypothesis testing can be done to determine if there is a significant association between variables.

Option C suggests that the study should be reported in terms of odds ratio. This is not necessarily true. The appropriate measure of association depends on the type of outcome being studied. For rare outcomes like paralysis, odds ratio is often used, but relative risk can also be appropriate.

Option D states that the study should be reported in terms of relative risk. This is more likely to be the correct answer because relative risk is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome, and it is commonly used in cohort studies, which is the type of study implied here.

Option E suggests that participants act as their own controls. This is not applicable to the study described because the pediatrician is not comparing outcomes in the same individuals over time or with different interventions.

Therefore, the answer is D) It should be reported in terms of relative risk.",A,False

An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?","{'A': 'Radiation therapy', 'B': 'Intravenous dexamethasone therapy', 'C': 'Intravenous acyclovir therapy', 'D': 'Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy', 'E': 'Oral ibuprofen therapy\n""'}",B,"The patient presents with low back pain, weakness, sharp and radiating pain with a burning quality, cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum, weight loss, constipation, difficulty urinating, and neurologic findings including decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome, hyperreflexive deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski sign. These symptoms and signs suggest a spinal cord pathology, likely due to compression. The history of chronic smoking and the presence of multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs on the chest x-ray raise the possibility of lung cancer with metastasis to the spine.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to address the spinal cord compression, which is a medical emergency. Radiation therapy (A) is a treatment option for metastatic cancer, but it is not the immediate next step in the management of acute spinal cord compression. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy (B) is used to reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord and is the appropriate initial treatment for spinal cord compression. Intravenous acyclovir therapy (C) is used for viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus, which do not align with the patient's presentation. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy (D) is used for bacterial infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, which is not indicated in this case. Oral ibuprofen therapy (E) is used for pain relief but would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to administer intravenous dexamethasone therapy to reduce spinal cord edema and prevent further neurologic deterioration.

The answer is B) Intravenous dexamethasone therapy.",B,True

A pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's disease would result in an excess of ACTH production, which stimulates cortisol release from the adrenal glands.

In the dexamethasone suppression test, low-dose dexamethasone should suppress ACTH in normal individuals and those with Cushing's syndrome caused by adrenal tumors or ectopic ACTH production. However, in Cushing's disease caused by a pituitary adenoma, low-dose dexamethasone will not suppress ACTH because the source of ACTH is the pituitary adenoma itself, which is resistant to glucocorticoid feedback inhibition.

High-dose dexamethasone, on the other hand, should suppress ACTH in all cases, as it provides negative feedback at the level of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH",C,False
A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,"{'A': 'Foot abduction brace', 'B': 'Osteotomy of the metatarsals', 'C': 'Arthrodesis of the forefoot', 'D': 'Reassurance', 'E': 'Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy'}",D,"The newborn has a congenital foot deformity known as metatarsus adductus, which is characterized by an inward curvature of the forefoot. This condition is often associated with oligohydramnios during pregnancy. The physical examination findings and the correction of the deformity with tickling the lateral border of the foot (a positive Barton's test) support this diagnosis. The increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones on X-ray is also consistent with metatarsus adductus.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to provide reassurance (Option D). Metatarsus adductus is a common and usually benign condition that often resolves spontaneously as the child grows. Treatment is typically not necessary unless the deformity is severe or persistent.

"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope.

In this case, the patient is experiencing difficulty initiating sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings, which suggests a sleep-onset type of insomnia.

Option A, Citalopram, is an SSRI antidepressant and is not primarily used for the treatment of insomnia. It is used for depression and anxiety disorders.

Option B, Chlordiazepoxide, is a benzodiazepine that can be used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. However, it is not the most appropriate option in this case due to the risk of dependence and tolerance.

Option C, Triazolam, is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is commonly used for the treatment of sleep-onset insomnia. It helps in initiating sleep but may cause daytime sedation and has a potential for dependence.

Option D, Diazepam, is a long-acting benzodiazepine that is not typically used for insomnia due to its long half-life, which can lead to daytime sedation and cognitive impairment.

Option E, Modafinil, is a wakefulness-promoting agent and is used to treat excessive sleepiness associated with conditions like narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. It is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the need for pharmacological intervention, the most appropriate option for treating her insomnia would be Triazolam (C).

She was born at 38 weeks' gestation and required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her mother has noticed the bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed and improve when she cried. The patient's pulse is 163/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?","{'A': 'Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray', 'B': 'Boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray', 'C': 'Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible', 'D': 'Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible', 'E': 'Scaphoid abdomen'}",D,"The newborn's symptoms of noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and intermittent respiratory distress, along with the improvement of discoloration when crying, suggest a condition known as ""cyanotic spells"" or ""Tet spells."" These are characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect that includes four abnormalities: ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The ""boot-shaped"" heart on chest x-ray is a classic finding in TOF due to the narrowing of the pulmonary artery and the hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient would be a ""boot-shaped"" heart on chest x-ray. The answer is B) Boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray.",B,False

"An 80-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department in a confused state with history of general illness for the past week. He is known to be hypertensive, but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. Physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 μm3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. Which of the following would be the best initial management for this patient's condition?","{'A': 'Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)', 'B': 'Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)', 'C': 'Calcium channel blocker (CCB)', 'D': 'Beta-blocker (BB)', 'E': 'Thiazide'}",A,"The patient is an elderly African American man with a history of hypertension, presenting with confusion, dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is significantly elevated at 180/99 mm Hg. The laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normal at 90 μm3, and the platelet count is within normal limits.

Given the patient's renal impairment, as indicated by the elevated BUN and creatinine, using medications that affect renal function, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, may not be the best initial management. These medications can further compromise renal function in a patient already showing signs of renal insufficiency.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are effective antihypertensive agents and do not have the same renal concerns as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. They can be used in patients with renal impairment and are a good choice for initial management in this case.

Beta-blockers (BBs) are also used in hypertension management but are not typically the first choice in the setting of acute presentation with confusion, which may suggest a hyperkinetic circulatory state, especially in the context of renal impairment.

Thiazide diuretics are often used in hypertension management, but given the patient's renal impairment, they may not be the best initial choice due to the potential for further worsening renal function.

Therefore, the best initial management for this patient's condition, considering his renal impairment and the need for antihypertensive therapy, would be a calcium channel blocker.

The answer is C) Calcium channel blocker (CCB).",C,False

The combination of restlessness, irregular movements, twitching of the face and tongue, and impaired memory is characteristic of Huntington's disease, which is a genetic disorder that leads to degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes.",C,False
"A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough. He reports having shortness of breath over the last 6 months, but he has felt worse since he contracted a cold that has been traveling around his office. Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?","{'A': 'Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis', 'B': 'Primary respiratory acidosis', 'C': 'Primary respiratory alkalosis', 'D': 'Compensatory respiratory acidosis', 'E': 'Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis'}",B,"The patient's history of chronic cough, shortness of breath, and a 30-pack-year smoking history, along with physical examination findings of a barrel-shaped chest and pursed-lip breathing, are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest X-ray findings of a flattened diaphragm are also consistent with COPD. Pulmonary function testing showing an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% confirms the diagnosis of obstructive lung disease.

In COPD, there is airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, most commonly due to cigarette smoking.

The patient's chronic respiratory condition would likely lead to a chronic respiratory acidosis due to retention of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the patient's current presentation with a productive cough and fever suggests that he may also have an acute exacerbation of his COPD with an acute respiratory acidosis on top of the chronic respiratory acidosis.

Therefore, the arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal a primary respiratory acidosis due to the chronic CO2 retention from his underlying COPD, with the possibility of an additional acute respiratory acidosis due to the exacerbation.

The answer is B) Primary respiratory acidosis.",B,True
"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was driving a motorcycle and collided with a bus. The EMT personnel found the patient alert with anterograde amnesia for the several minutes preceding the accident. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?","{'A': 'Tearing of the middle meningeal artery', 'B': 'Dural arteriovenous fistula', 'C': 'Tearing of bridging veins', 'D': 'Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm', 'E': 'Arteriovenous malformation'}",A,"The patient's presentation with anterograde amnesia, acute decline in consciousness, and hypertension suggests a traumatic brain injury. The finding of a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex indicates a possible herniation event, where increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is causing compression of the third cranial nerve on the side of the dilated pupil. The CT image would help confirm the diagnosis by showing signs of hemorrhage or mass effect.

Among the options provided, tearing of the middle meningeal artery (A) is a common cause of epidural hematoma, which can present with a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration as seen in this patient. This is due to arterial bleeding that can rapidly increase ICP and cause herniation.

Dural arteriovenous fistula (B) and tearing of bridging veins (C) are more commonly associated with subdural hematomas, which tend to present with a more gradual onset of symptoms.

Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm (D) is associated with chronic hypertension and small intracerebral hemorrhages, not acute trauma.

Arteriovenous malformation (E) could potentially cause a hemorrhage, but it is less likely to be the cause in the context of trauma and the described clinical presentation.

Given the acute presentation with a lucid interval followed by rapid decline, and the finding of a fixed and dilated pupil, the most likely etiology is an epidural hematoma due to arterial bleeding, most commonly from the middle meningeal artery. Therefore, the answer is A) Tearing of the middle meningeal artery.",A,True
A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

The absence of a murmur makes aortic stenosis (C) less likely. Dilated cardiomyopathy (A) and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (D) are typically associated with dilated heart chambers and may present with signs of heart failure, which are not described in this case. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (E) is characterized by restrictive filling and reduced diastolic volume of either or both ventricles with normal or near-normal systolic function; it is less likely to present with sudden loss of consciousness. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (B), on the other hand, is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and can present with a prominent A wave, a double apical impulse due to a thickened interventricular septum, and an S4 due to a stiff left ventricle. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",A,False

The absence of casts or dysmorphic RBCs in the urine makes tubular lumen obstruction (option A) and glomerular inflammation (option B) less likely. Bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma (option C) typically presents with signs of infection such as fever, flank pain, and pyuria, which are not prominent in this case. Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels (option E) is not a common cause of hematuria.

The patient's history of chronic tension headaches and the use of aspirin, an NSAID, is significant. NSAIDs can cause analgesic nephropathy, which is characterized by nephronophthyisis and can lead to chronic kidney disease. This can present with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria, as seen in this patient. Lipid peroxidation within tubular cells (option D) is a mechanism by which NSAIDs can cause renal damage.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria is lipid peroxidation within tubular cells due to analgesic nephropathy from chronic NSAID use. The answer is D) Lipid peroxidation within tubular cells.",A,False
"A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient’s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses.

The history of taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin could have led to renal papillary necrosis, a condition that can cause hematuria and flank pain. However, the presence of proteinuria and absence of palpable flank masses make renal papillary necrosis less likely. Chronic pyelonephritis typically presents with recurrent urinary tract infections and is less likely to cause gross hematuria and acute flank pain. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that usually presents with hypertension, multiple kidney cysts, and sometimes hematuria, but not typically with acute, colicky flank pain. Diffuse cortical necrosis is a rare and severe condition usually associated with obstetric catastrophes and septic shock, not with the presentation described. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is E) Acute Nephrolithiasis.",C,False
"A 39-year-old woman presents with headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min.

Cortisol exerts its effects through intracellular receptors, which then act as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Therefore, the hormone excess responsible for her symptoms uses intracellular receptors to exert its action. The answer is A) Intracellular receptors.",A,True
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?","{'A': 'Diphenhydramine', 'B': 'Amoxicillin', 'C': 'Fexofenadine', 'D': 'Vitamin K', 'E': 'Calamine lotion'}",C,"The patient presents with generalized pruritus, raised erythematous plaques, clear liquid discharge from the nose, and sneezing. These symptoms began suddenly after eating at a seafood restaurant, suggesting an allergic reaction, possibly to something he ate. The fact that he has had similar symptoms in the past supports this diagnosis. His history of narrow-angle glaucoma is a contraindication to the use of antihistamines that can cause pupillary dilation, such as diphenhydramine (option A). Therefore, a non-sedating antihistamine like fexofenadine (option C) would be a safer choice. Amoxicillin (option B) is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate for an allergic reaction. Vitamin K (option D) is used to reverse the effects of warfarin and has no role in the treatment of allergic reactions. Calamine lotion (option E) can be used to soothe itchy skin but would not address the other symptoms of allergy such as sneezing and rhinorrhea. Thus, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is fexofenadine.",A,False
A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?,"{'A': 'Hypersensitivity reaction', 'B': 'Asbestos inhalation', 'C': 'Neoplastic transformation', 'D': 'Opportunistic colonization', 'E': 'Abscess formation'}",D,"The patient has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and presents with cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. The presence of inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area and a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning suggests a pulmonary nodule or mass. The fact that the sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures indicates that the mass is not due to an active tuberculosis infection.

Considering the options:
A. Hypersensitivity reaction - This is less likely because hypersensitivity reactions typically do not present as radiopaque masses.
B. Asbestos inhalation - This could cause a radiopaque mass, but asbestos-related diseases usually have a latency period of several decades, making it less likely in a 60-year-old.
C. Neoplastic transformation - This is a possible cause of a radiopaque mass that does not shift upon repositioning, suggesting a solid tumor.
D. Opportunistic colonization - This is unlikely because the mass shifts upon repositioning, which is not characteristic of colonization by bacteria or fungi.
E. Abscess formation - Abscesses are typically associated with infection and would be expected to grow bacteria in cultures.

Given the information, the most likely cause of the radiopaque mass that does not shift upon repositioning and the patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis is neoplastic transformation. Therefore, the answer is C) Neoplastic transformation.",C,False
"An elderly man presents to his physician with complaints of difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling which began 2 months ago. His breathlessness worsens while walking, climbing the stairs, and lying flat on his back. He also finds it difficult to sleep well at night, as he often wakes up to catch his breath. His pulse is 98/min and blood pressure is 114/90 mm Hg. On examination, he has mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs. His respiratory rate is 33/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases. On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex. Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?","{'A': 'Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential', 'B': 'Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient', 'C': 'Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels', 'D': 'Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption', 'E': 'Reduction in myocardial contractility'}",B,"The patient presents with symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), including difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, bilateral leg swelling, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The physical examination findings of distended neck veins, bilateral pitting edema, coarse crepitations over the lung bases, loud P2 at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm at the apex are consistent with this diagnosis.

The medication prescribed for his symptoms has changed his cardiac physiology by reducing myocardial contractility. This is evident from the reduction in the slope of the Frank-Starling curve post-medication, as represented by the dashed line.

The mechanism of action of the medication that reduces myocardial contractility is typically achieved by calcium entry blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) or beta-blockers (such as metoprolol or carvedilol). These medications decrease the force of myocardial contraction, which helps to reduce the workload on the heart and improve symptoms in patients with heart failure.

Therefore, the answer is E) Reduction in myocardial contractility.",E,False
"A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate. She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?","{'A': 'Head CT', 'B': 'Head MRI', 'C': 'Lumbar puncture', 'D': 'Post void residual volumes', 'E': ""Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors""}",B,"The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms including an inability to urinate, transient episodes of trouble speaking and changes in vision, extreme facial pain exacerbated by actions such as brushing teeth or plucking hairs, and a history of sexual abuse. The physical exam finding of abnormal eye movement (leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward) suggests a possible neurological disorder. Given the patient's history and symptoms, a central nervous system (CNS) pathology should be considered.

The best initial test to evaluate for possible CNS pathology would be imaging studies. Between a head CT and a head MRI, an MRI provides more detailed images of the brain and is more sensitive in detecting abnormalities such as demyelinating lesions, which could be consistent with the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the answer is B) Head MRI.",B,True

Among the options provided, the one that is known to cause side effects such as anemia is inhibition of ferrochelatase. Ferrochelatase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of heme, and its inhibition can lead to anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Inhibition of ferrochelatase.",A,False
"A 29-year-old G4P0 woman presents following a spontaneous pregnancy loss in the 18th week of her pregnancy. This is her fourth loss in the second trimester and she is concerned about her inability to have a successful pregnancy. She is otherwise healthy and has no acute complaints. Her vitals are unremarkable and exam is notable only for a firm, asymmetric uterus. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
Hematocrit: 30%

The laboratory studies provided show a hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 30%, and a platelet count of 199,000/mm^3. These values do not immediately suggest a hematologic cause for her recurrent pregnancy losses.

Given the patient's history and the fact that the uterus is described as firm and asymmetric, one possible cause of recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses is Asherman's syndrome, which is characterized by intrauterine adhesions. These adhesions can result from trauma to the uterine lining, such as that caused by procedures like dilation and curettage (D&C) following a miscarriage.

To evaluate for intrauterine adhesions, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is the most appropriate test. An HSG involves the injection of a contrast dye into the uterus and fallopian tubes and taking X-rays to visualize the uterine cavity. This test can help identify any abnormalities such as adhesions or blockages that could contribute to recurrent pregnancy losses.

Therefore, the answer is C) Hysterosalpingogram.",C,True
"A 32-year-old male presents to the ED with acute-onset chest pain. His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?","{'A': 'Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine', 'B': 'Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines', 'C': 'Antagonizing the NMDA receptor', 'D': 'Activating the acetylcholine receptor', 'E': 'Inhibiting the GABA receptor'}",A,"The patient's presentation with acute-onset chest pain, ST segment elevation, and the need for cardiac intervention suggests an acute coronary syndrome, possibly a myocardial infarction. The patient's history of being largely unemployed, recently homeless, and admitting to alcohol and marijuana use, but denying illicit drug use, provides a social context that may be relevant to his current condition.

The key clinical findings that may point towards a specific substance use are the dilated pupils and the perforated nasal septum. Dilated pupils can be a sign of stimulant use, while a perforated nasal septum is a known complication of chronic cocaine snorting.

Cocaine is a stimulant that causes sympathomimetic effects such as hypertension and tachycardia, which are consistent with the patient's elevated blood pressure and pulse rate. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain.

Therefore, the most likely agent responsible for this patient's presentation is cocaine, which blocks reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.

The answer is A) Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.",A,True

Galantamine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine levels in the brain and can cause gastrointestinal side effects due to increased parasympathetic activity. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy to counteract these side effects would be an anticholinergic agent.

Among the options provided, atropine is an anticholinergic medication that can be used to treat the gastrointestinal side effects caused by galantamine. Therefore, the answer is D) Atropine.",D,True

Rationalization is a defense mechanism where controversial behaviors or feelings are justified and explained in a seemingly rational or logical manner to avoid the true explanation. In this case, the patient acknowledges his weight gain but justifies it by saying that being overweight runs in his family and that he prefers to enjoy himself and eat what he wants rather than fight it. This response is a way of rationalizing his behavior and choices. Therefore, the answer is A) Rationalization.",A,True

The laboratory findings of hypertension, hyperglycemia (elevated glucose), hypokalemia (low potassium), and metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate) further support this diagnosis.

The low level of ACTH suggests that the source of excess cortisol is not ACTH-dependent. Therefore, a primary adrenal cause (adrenal adenoma or carcinoma) is more likely than an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease) or ectopic ACTH production.

Given these findings, the most appropriate treatment would be to address the source of excess cortisol production. Since the ACTH level is low, it is unlikely that the cause is an ACTH-producing tumor, which would have elevated ACTH levels. Therefore, options A (Metyrapone therapy), D (Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy), and E (Partial nephrectomy) are not appropriate.

Option C (Polychemotherapy and radiation therapy) is used for treatment of malignancies and there is no indication that this patient has cancer.

Option B (Adrenalectomy) is the most appropriate treatment as it involves surgical removal of the adrenal glands, which are the source of excess cortisol production in this patient with Cushing's syndrome.

Therefore, the answer is B) Adrenalectomy.",B,True

Which of the following is the best measure to prevent the progression of the symptoms present in this patient?","{'A': 'Use of atorvastatin', 'B': 'Femoro-Ileal artery bypass', 'C': 'Strict blood glucose control', 'D': 'Strict control of blood pressure', 'E': 'Lower limb amputation'}",C,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy, as evidenced by tingling and numbness in the lower limbs, along with persistent pain that is not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. The decreased sensation to pain in both lower limbs, along with intact deep tendon reflexes, further supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history of diabetes, it is important to address glycemic control as a means of preventing further progression of diabetic complications, including peripheral neuropathy. The patient's fasting blood glucose level is elevated at 141 mg/dL, and the 2-hour post-prandial blood glucose level is 235 mg/dL, indicating poor glycemic control. The HbA1c level of 8.1% also suggests suboptimal blood glucose control over the past few months.

While strict blood pressure control (option D) and lower limb amputation (option E) may be important in certain cases of peripheral arterial disease or severe diabetic foot ulcers, they are not the primary measures for preventing the progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Use of atorvastatin (option A) is typically indicated for managing hyperlipidemia and preventing cardiovascular events, but it does not directly address the progression of neuropathy. Femoro-ileal artery bypass (option B) is a surgical intervention for peripheral arterial disease, not for neuropathy.

Therefore, the best measure to prevent the progression of the symptoms present in this patient is strict blood glucose control (option C). By achieving better glycemic control, there is a potential to slow down the progression of diabetic complications, including peripheral neuropathy.

Therefore, the answer is C) Strict blood glucose control.",A,False
A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit for shortness of breath and palpitations.

This indicates that the patient's left ventricle is experiencing increased end-diastolic pressure and decreased contractility. Increased systemic vascular resistance (option B) would cause a different pattern on the pressure-volume loop. Mitral valve regurgitation (option A) and aortic stenosis (option E) typically affect the flow across the valves rather than the overall shape of the pressure-volume loop. Increased ventricular wall stiffness (option C) would cause the loop to be shifted to the right but not necessarily down. Impaired left ventricular contractility (option D) is consistent with the loop being shifted to the right and down, as seen in the patient's data. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is impaired left ventricular contractility.",A,False

On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:

She shows signs of puberty such as axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. Her labs show a normal FSH level and a low estradiol level. The normal FSH level rules out primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), as POI is characterized by elevated FSH levels due to decreased feedback inhibition from ovarian hormones. Muellerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a condition where the uterus and upper part of the vagina are absent, but this condition would not explain the low estradiol level. Hyperprolactinemia typically presents with galactorrhea and amenorrhea, but the normal FSH and estradiol levels do not support this diagnosis. Turner syndrome is characterized by a 45,X karyotype and is associated with primary amenorrhea, short stature, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics, which is not consistent with the patient’s presentation. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition where an individual has a male 46,XY karyotype but is resistant to androgens, leading to a female phenotype. The patient’s normal estradiol level and the presence of secondary sexual characteristics, along with the low testosterone level, suggest AIS as the most likely diagnosis.

However, Staphylococcus aureus typically causes rapid-onset vomiting and is not usually associated with diarrhea. Bacillus cereus, on the other hand, can cause either diarrhea or vomiting, depending on the serotype, and is commonly associated with rice and pasta that has been left at room temperature for a period of time. Given the patient's symptoms and the history of eating reheated food, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillus cereus infection. Therefore, the answer is C) Bacillus cereus infection.",C,True

Tetralogy of Fallot is a specific type of congenital heart defect that is not particularly associated with Down syndrome. Omphalocele is an abdominal wall defect that can occur in infants with Down syndrome, but it is not the condition that they are at an increased risk for having.

His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential

He presents with painless neck swelling without systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss. His physical examination reveals multiple non-tender lymph nodes in the neck. Laboratory studies show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but otherwise, his blood counts are normal. An excisional biopsy of the lymph node shows characteristic histopathologic features.

Given the patient's history of HIV, one possible diagnosis is HIV lymphadenopathy (C), which is a common finding in patients with HIV. However, the presence of multiple non-tender lymph nodes without systemic symptoms and the elevated ESR suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder.

Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B) typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, which are absent in this patient. Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) would likely present with abnormal blood counts and systemic symptoms. Mononucleosis can cause lymphadenopathy, but it is usually associated with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, none of which are reported by the patient. Phenytoin-induced adenopathy (E) is a known side effect of phenytoin, but it is less likely to cause multiple non-tender lymph nodes and an elevated ESR.

The histopathologic analysis would provide the definitive diagnosis, but based on the clinical presentation and the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B).",E,False

Based on the general understanding of renal physiology, urea is typically reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, leading to a higher concentration in the tubular fluid initially but a lower concentration as it moves along the tubule.

Therefore, if we assume that the graph follows this typical pattern, the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea would decrease as it moves along the proximal convoluted tubule.

"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor.

The history of eating food at a picnic and the similar symptoms in a friend suggest a common source of exposure, likely the food. Among the foods listed, potato salad, deviled eggs, and pickles are commonly associated with botulism, which is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to a flaccid paralysis. However, the cranial nerve exam findings of fixed pupillary dilation and difficulty depressing both eyes are more consistent with anticholinergic effects, which can be seen with other types of poisoning such as organophosphate poisoning (which would increase acetylcholine release) or atropine poisoning (which is an anticholinergic). Given the context of the picnic and the symptoms, it is more likely that the patient and his friend were exposed to a toxin that mimics the effects of atropine.

Acyclovir can cause crystalline nephropathy, but this is less likely without evidence of urinary obstruction or recent high doses of the medication. Atorvastatin and Metoprolol are not typically associated with renal impairment. Metformin can cause lactic acidosis, but this is typically associated with a significant drop in pH, which is not seen in this patient's labs. Additionally, the patient's bicarbonate level is not low, which makes lactic acidosis less likely. Insulin is used to manage hyperglycemia and would not be the cause of renal impairment. Given the patient's history and the lack of any clear medication cause, the most likely explanation for the renal impairment is his underlying diabetic nephropathy, which is worsening.

"A 32-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of weight loss, night sweats, and productive cough. Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?","{'A': 'Secretion of interferon-α', 'B': 'Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands', 'C': 'Opsonization by complement proteins', 'D': 'Secretion of interleukin-4', 'E': 'Generation of reactive oxygen species'}",B,"The patient in the question has HIV and presents with symptoms consistent with tuberculosis (TB), such as weight loss, night sweats, and a productive cough. The presence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum confirms the diagnosis of TB. The patient's immune system is compromised due to HIV, which makes him more susceptible to TB.

The tuberculin skin test (TST), also known as the Mantoux test, is used to detect exposure to the bacterium that causes TB. The test involves injecting a small amount of tuberculin fluid into the skin and examining the injected area 48 hours later for induration (swelling) or erythema (redness). A positive TST indicates that the person has been exposed to TB bacteria and has mounted an immune response to them.

In this case, the patient's TST shows no induration or erythema, indicating a negative result. This suggests an impairment in the immune response to the TB antigens.

Let's evaluate the options:

A. Secretion of interferon-α: Interferon-α is involved in the immune response to viral infections and is not directly related to the TST.

B. Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands: This interaction is involved in the co-stimulation of T cells during an immune response. It is a part of the immune response but is not specifically related to the TST.

C. Opsonization by complement proteins: Opsonization is a process where pathogens are marked for destruction by phagocytes. Complement proteins are part of the innate immune system and are not directly related to the TST.

D. Secretion of interleukin-4: Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that plays a role in the differentiation of naive helper T cells to Th2 cells. It is involved in the immune response, particularly in promoting antibody production and B cell class switching. However, it is not directly related to the TST.

E. Generation of reactive oxygen species: Reactive oxygen species are produced by phagocytes to kill ingested microbes. While this is part of the immune response, it is not specifically related",B,True

"A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient’s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient’s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient’s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies.

The presence of a papulovesicular rash on the abdomen and back, as well as aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity, suggests dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease. The positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies further support the diagnosis of celiac disease.

In celiac disease, the ingestion of gluten leads to an immune-mediated inflammatory response in the small intestine, resulting in villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. Therefore, the most likely finding on intestinal biopsy in this patient would be:

C) Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.",C,True
"A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy.

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""","{'A': 'HBsAg', 'B': 'Anti-HAV IgG', 'C': 'HCV RNA', 'D': 'Anti-HCV IgG', 'E': 'Anti-HEV IgM'}",E,"The patient presents with lethargy, nausea, vomiting, fever, jaundice, and asterixis. The laboratory findings indicate a marked elevation in liver enzymes (AST and ALT), hyperbilirubinemia, and prolonged prothrombin time, which are suggestive of acute liver injury or hepatitis. The patient's recent travel history to Sudan raises the possibility of exposure to infectious hepatitis.

The negative results for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-CMV antibody, anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody, and ELISA for HIV suggest that autoimmune hepatitis, cytomegalovirus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and HIV-related liver injury are less likely.

Given the patient's travel history and clinical presentation, the most likely causes of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. Hepatitis A and E are typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route and are usually self-limited. Hepatitis B and C are more likely to cause chronic infection and are transmitted via blood or body fluids.

Since the patient has not received blood products and denies eating any raw or undercooked seafood or other potential sources of hepatitis A or E, and given the high endemicity of hepatitis E in Sudan, hepatitis E is a likely diagnosis. Hepatitis E is often associated with travel to endemic areas and is typically self-limited in immunocompetent individuals.

Therefore, the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis would be detection of anti-HEV IgM antibodies, which indicate an acute infection with hepatitis E virus.

The answer is E) Anti-HEV IgM.",E,True

Hospice care is designed for terminally ill patients who are expected to have 6 months or less to live if the disease follows its usual course. The patient’s eligibility for hospice care should be based on his prognosis and whether he meets the criteria for hospice admission, which typically include a limited life expectancy and a decision to focus on comfort rather than curative treatment.

To determine eligibility for hospice care, the physician should:

- Assess the patient’s life expectancy without treatment to understand if he falls within the typical 6-month timeframe for hospice care.
- Confirm that the patient’s condition is terminal and that there is no curative treatment plan being pursued.
- Verify that the patient’s wishes align with the goals of hospice care, which include comfort and quality of life.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to determine the patient’s life expectancy without treatment (Option B) to assess if he qualifies for hospice care based on his prognosis and the typical guidelines for hospice admission.

The laboratory studies show a low platelet count (48,000/mm3), which is indicative of thrombocytopenia. The normal prothrombin time (15 seconds) and activated partial thromboplastin time (40 seconds) suggest that the coagulation pathway is intact.

Given the patient's recent surgery and the use of unfractionated heparin, it is likely that the patient's symptoms are due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is an immune-mediated adverse reaction to heparin that leads to platelet activation and aggregation, resulting in thrombocytopenia and a risk of thrombosis. The mechanism of HIT involves autoantibody-mediated platelet activation, which leads to the formation of platelet aggregates and microthrombi in small vessels, causing thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.

Rabies virus is known to target the neuronal nuclei and the synaptic junctions in the brain. It primarily affects the central nervous system and leads to encephalitis. The virus enters the nervous system through the peripheral nerves and then spreads to the central nervous system. It targets neurons and causes their destruction.

The rabies virus binds to and enters cells by targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the surface of neurons. These receptors are found in high concentrations in the neuromuscular junction but are also present in other regions of the nervous system. Once inside the neuron, the virus can replicate and spread to other neurons, causing the characteristic symptoms of rabies, which include acute onset of seizures, hallucinations, and rapid deterioration.

Therefore, the answer is C) Acetylcholine receptor.",C,True

Delirium tremens is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment. The most appropriate initial treatment for delirium tremens is benzodiazepines, which help to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications such as seizures. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine and would be the most appropriate initial course of treatment for this patient. Therefore, the answer is C) Diazepam.",C,True
"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath for 6 hours. For the past 5 days, he has had intermittent stabbing pain in the middle of his chest that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths. He has also had a runny nose and a dry cough for the past 2 weeks. He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His current medications include atorvastatin, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide. He appears pale and sweaty. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 25/min. Blood pressure is 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?","{'A': 'Dilation of the atria and ventricles', 'B': 'Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity', 'C': 'Occlusion of a coronary artery', 'D': 'Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space', 'E': 'Fibrous thickening of the pericardium'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, intermittent stabbing chest pain that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths, runny nose, and dry cough for the past 2 weeks, along with the physical examination findings of jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees, suggest a cardiovascular etiology. The presence of fever (temperature of 38.3°C), tachycardia (pulse of 105/min), and hypotension (blood pressure of 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration) are indicative of a systemic inflammatory response.

The differential diagnosis for these findings includes pericarditis, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pleural effusion, and constrictive pericarditis. The patient's symptoms are not typical of a myocardial infarction, which usually presents with acute chest pain that does not change with position or breathing. Congestive heart failure could be a consideration; however, the patient's symptoms are more acute in nature and do not align with the typical presentation of chronic heart failure. Pleural effusion could cause shortness of breath and chest pain but would not typically cause fever or significant changes in blood pressure with respiration.

The most likely cause of this patient's findings is pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium. This condition can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space (pericardial effusion), resulting in cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is characterized by hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad), which can be inferred from the patient's presentation. The patient's fever and acute onset of symptoms suggest an infectious etiology, such as viral pericarditis or bacterial pericarditis. Fibrous thickening of the pericardium is a chronic process and would not typically present acutely.

Therefore, the answer is D) Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.",D,True
"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?","{'A': 'Affinity maturation', 'B': 'Random assortment', 'C': 'Random nucleotide addition', 'D': 'VDJ recombination', 'E': 'Isotype switching'}",E,"The question describes a scenario where a protein in the patient's serum, which is thought to be elevated in response to her condition, binds strongly to a protein labeled with a fluorescent marker from the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages. This suggests an immune response to an infection. The amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein undergoes a process that allows it to bind specifically to the target protein. This specific binding is characteristic of antibodies, which recognize and bind to antigens.

In immunocompetent individuals, the process that generates the diversity of antibodies is VDJ recombination (option D). VDJ recombination is a mechanism that occurs in B cells during their development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are randomly recombined to generate unique antigen receptor genes. This process allows for the generation of a vast repertoire of antibodies, each with a unique antigen-binding site.

Affinity maturation (option A) is a process that occurs in the germinal centers of lymph nodes after antigen exposure, leading to the selection of B cells that produce antibodies with increased affinity for the antigen. Random assortment (option B) is not a specific term used in immunology. Random nucleotide addition (option C) does not refer to a specific process in antibody generation. Isotype switching (option E) is a process that occurs in activated B cells, where the constant region of the antibody molecule changes, resulting in a different class of antibody (e.g., IgG, IgA), but it does not affect the antigen-binding specificity.

Therefore, the answer is D) VDJ recombination.",A,False

Therefore, the answer is B) Wide pulse pressure.",B,True
"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?","{'A': 'Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle', 'B': 'This patient has insulin resistance', 'C': 'Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient', 'D': 'The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism', 'E': 'The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction'}",C,"The patient is presenting with amenorrhea, which is the absence of menstruation. She has intentionally restricted her diet, exercised intensively, and lost a significant amount of weight. The physical examination findings of hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, and decreased adiposity, along with a bone scan showing decreased calcium mineral deposits, are suggestive of the Female Athlete Triad. This condition is characterized by disordered eating, excessive exercise, and low energy availability, which can lead to amenorrhea due to hypoestrogenemia.

Option A suggests that hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens, which is not supported by the information provided.

Option B suggests insulin resistance, which is not indicated in this scenario.

Option C states that decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia. This is consistent with the Female Athlete Triad, where low body fat can lead to reduced estrogen production.

Option D suggests increased liver metabolism due to hyperthyroidism, which is not supported by the clinical findings.

Option E also suggests checking for hyperthyroidism, but the clinical findings do not point towards thyroid dysfunction as the primary cause of her symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.",A,False
A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications.

The genetic evaluation revealing a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin is indicative of Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2). NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss and unsteadiness in gait. Patients with NF2 are at increased risk for developing other types of benign tumors of the nervous system, such as meningiomas. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Meningioma.",B,True
A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing weakness in both legs for 7 days. She also reports a tingling sensation in her legs that is exacerbated by taking a hot shower. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F). Physical examination shows decreased muscle strength and clonus in both lower extremities. Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?,"{'A': 'Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum', 'B': 'Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy', 'C': 'Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation', 'D': 'Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture', 'E': 'Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum\n""'}",C,"The patient's symptoms of increasing weakness in both legs, tingling sensation exacerbated by heat, decreased muscle strength, clonus, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign (extensor plantar reflex) are suggestive of a central nervous system disorder. The absence of abdominal reflex and the presence of fever may also be relevant.

The MRI of the brain, although not described in the question, would provide important diagnostic clues. Based on the clinical presentation and the options provided, the most likely diagnosis to consider would be multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. MS is more common in women and can present with a variety of neurological symptoms.

Now let's analyze the options:

A. Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum - This finding is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not MS.

B. Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy - This finding would suggest a polyomavirus infection of the central nervous system, such as BK virus or JC virus, not MS.

C. Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation - This finding could be seen in conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), which are peripheral nervous system disorders and not consistent with the central nervous system findings in this patient.

D. Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture - This would indicate a bacterial infection, such as streptococcal infection, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation of MS.

E. Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum - This finding is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not MS.

None of the options provided directly support the diagnosis of MS. However, the most relevant option in the context of central nervous system pathology would be B, as polyomavirus infections can cause demyelination and could theoretically be seen on brain biopsy in a",B,False
"A 28-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of fever, chills, and generalized weakness. He has no cough. He was treated for a neck abscess 6 months ago.

Transthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two sets of blood cultures are collected. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""","{'A': 'Transesophageal echocardiography', 'B': 'Intravenous vancomycin therapy', 'C': 'X-ray of the chest', 'D': 'CT pulmonary angiogram', 'E': 'Intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy\n""'}",B,"The patient presents with fever, chills, generalized weakness, a history of intravenous drug use, retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth's spots), and a new holosystolic murmur. These findings are highly suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly tricuspid valve endocarditis given the history of intravenous drug use and the presence of vegetations on the tricuspid valve. Roth's spots are retinal hemorrhages with pale centers that are associated with endocarditis. The most appropriate next step in management after blood cultures is to start empiric antibiotic therapy while awaiting blood culture results. Intravenous antibiotics are required for the treatment of infective endocarditis. Vancomycin is a good choice for empiric coverage because it covers methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a common pathogen in intravenous drug users. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) could be considered to further evaluate the extent of endocarditis, but it is not the immediate next step before starting antibiotics. An X-ray of the chest or a CT pulmonary angiogram would be indicated if there was a suspicion of pulmonary embolism or another pulmonary process, which is not suggested by the current clinical scenario. Intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy is not appropriate for the treatment of infective endocarditis. Therefore, the answer is B) Intravenous vancomycin therapy.",B,True

These symptoms are suggestive of a hip disorder. Given the patient's age and the acute presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is a common hip disorder in adolescents, especially those who are obese.

The best management for SCFE is surgical intervention to stabilize the femoral head. Surgical pinning of the femoral head (option E) is the standard treatment for SCFE. This procedure helps to maintain the blood supply to the femoral head and prevents further slippage.

Therefore, the answer is E) Surgical pinning of the femoral head.",E,True
"A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40℃ (104℉)) for 3 days.

The medication given is a bronchodilator, which works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways to improve breathing. The most common type of bronchodilator used in acute asthma exacerbations is a beta-2 agonist, such as albuterol.

Beta-2 agonists work by binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on the smooth muscle cells in the airways. This binding leads to activation of adenylate cyclase, which then increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. The increase in cAMP leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle cells, resulting in bronchodilation and relief of the airway obstruction.

Therefore, the downstream effect of the bronchodilator medication given to the child is increased adenylate cyclase activity.

The answer is E) Increased adenylate cyclase activity.",E,True

"A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for pain in his back. The patient describes the pain as feeling worse in the morning. He says it is a general stiffness that improves when he goes to the gym and lifts weights. He also states that his symptoms seem to improve when he leans forward or when he is cycling. The patient is a current smoker and is sexually active. He admits to having unprotected sex with many different partners this past year. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. On physical exam, the patient demonstrates notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions. The patient’s strength is 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities. The rest of his physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following findings is associated with this patient’s presentation?","{'A': 'Decreased levels of IgA', 'B': 'Diminished pulses in the lower extremity', 'C': 'Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright', 'D': 'Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down', 'E': 'Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed'}",E,"The patient’s symptoms of morning stiffness that improves with activity, kyphosis of the thoracic spine, and decreased mobility of the back suggest a spinal condition. The improvement of symptoms when leaning forward or cycling may indicate a flexible deformity of the spine. The patient’s sexual history and current smoking status are also relevant.

Option A (Decreased levels of IgA) is associated with conditions like selective IgA deficiency, which is not indicated by the patient’s presentation.

Option B (Diminished pulses in the lower extremity) could suggest vascular insufficiency or aortic dissection, which does not align with the patient’s symptoms and physical exam findings.

Option C (Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright) is characteristic of spinal stenosis, which can cause symptoms like pain and stiffness that may be relieved by leaning forward or flexion of the spine. This could be a possible diagnosis given the patient’s symptoms and physical exam findings.

Option D (Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down) is indicative of a positive straight leg raise test, which is commonly associated with sciatica due to herniated disc or lumbar spinal stenosis. However, the patient does not have radicular symptoms such as pain radiating down the leg, and his strength is intact.

Option E (Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed) is associated with conditions like psoriasis, which does not correlate with the patient’s symptoms and physical exam findings.

Based on the patient’s presentation, the most likely associated finding is narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright, which is consistent with spinal stenosis. Therefore, the answer is C) Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright.",A,False
A 71-year-old man complains of urinary hesitancy and nocturia of increasing frequency over the past several months.

The slightly enlarged prostate found on digital rectal exam and the elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level further support this diagnosis. The transabdominal ultrasound would likely show an enlarged prostate, although the image itself is not provided here.

The treatment for BPH typically includes medications that can help relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow and reduce symptoms. Among the options provided:

A) Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that is not typically used in the treatment of BPH.
B) Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that can reduce the size of the prostate over time by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to prostate growth.
C) Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is actually a more potent androgen than testosterone and can worsen BPH symptoms. It is not used as a treatment for BPH.
D) Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that has no role in the treatment of BPH.
E) Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to treat conditions like edema and hypertension, not BPH.

"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He has a history of constipation. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°C). Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?","{'A': 'Staphylococcal coagulase', 'B': 'Interferon-gamma', 'C': 'Lipoteichoic acid', 'D': 'Interleukin-3', 'E': 'Lysosomal enzymes'}",E,"The patient's clinical presentation and CT findings suggest a diagnosis of diverticulitis with an associated abscess, as evidenced by the segmental wall thickening of the descending colon, multiple diverticula, and the presence of a pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels that yielded 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid upon drainage. The formation of an abscess is typically due to the local release of inflammatory mediators and bacterial products that lead to the recruitment of neutrophils and the accumulation of fluid.

Among the options provided, the most likely substance responsible for the formation of the abscess is lysosomal enzymes (Option E). Lysosomal enzymes are released by neutrophils during the inflammatory response and are involved in the degradation of bacterial components, contributing to the formation of pus or abscesses.

Therefore, the answer is E) Lysosomal enzymes.",E,True
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness. He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening. Initially, he noticed blurry vision and some trouble speaking and swallowing but thought he was just coming down with a cold. He then noticed weakness of his facial muscles and shortness of breath. The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?","{'A': 'Antitoxin', 'B': 'Atropine', 'C': 'Neostigmine', 'D': 'Plasmapheresis', 'E': 'Riluzole'}",A,"The patient presents with symptoms of weakness, blurry vision, trouble speaking and swallowing, weakness of facial muscles, and shortness of breath. The fact that he works as a farmer and has been canning his own foods, along with recent diarrhea and a cough, suggests a possible exposure to botulinum toxin, which can be found in improperly canned or preserved foods. Botulinum toxin causes a blockade of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to a flaccid paralysis. The clinical presentation of the patient, including the inability to smile, dysarthric speech, shallow and weak breaths, and diminished reflexes, is consistent with botulism.

The best treatment for botulism is antitoxin, which can neutralize circulating toxin but will not reverse already bound toxin. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Antitoxin.",B,False
"A 42-year-old man presents to your office complaining of right-sided facial swelling that has progressively worsened over the last month after returning from a trip to India. On examination, the patient has an obvious distortion of the facial features on the right without erythema or lymphadenopathy. A neurological exam reveals no deficits. His blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F).

The absence of erythema or lymphadenopathy and the presence of neurological deficits suggest a non-infectious cause. The patient's trouble with chewing without pain also points away from an infectious etiology. Given the patient's up-to-date immunizations, an infection with paramyxovirus (option C) is less likely. Sialolithiasis (option E) typically presents with pain and is often associated with infection, which is not the case here. A malignant tumor composed of squamous and mucinous cells (option D) could present with facial swelling but is less likely given the absence of pain and neurological deficits. A benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue (option B) is a more likely cause of the symptoms described, especially given the progressive nature of the swelling and the absence of systemic signs of infection or inflammation. A benign cystic tumor with stroma resembling lymph node tissue (option A) is also a possibility, but the absence of lymphadenopathy makes this less likely.

"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?","{'A': 'Convergent validity', 'B': 'Discriminant validity', 'C': 'Positive predictive value', 'D': 'Negative predictive value', 'E': 'Test specificity'}",D,"The question is asking which test property would increase if the cut-off point for a tuberculin skin test is lowered from 5 mm to 4 mm.

Positive predictive value (PPV) refers to the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. Lowering the cut-off point would result in more individuals being classified as positive for the disease. However, this would also mean that there would be more false positives (individuals who test positive but do not have the disease). As a result, the PPV would decrease because the proportion of true positives among all positive test results would decrease.

Negative predictive value (NPV) refers to the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly do not have the disease. Lowering the cut-off point would result in fewer individuals being classified as negative for the disease. This means that there would be fewer false negatives (individuals who test negative but have the disease). As a result, the NPV would increase because the proportion of true negatives among all negative test results would increase.

Convergent validity, discriminant validity, and test specificity are not directly affected by changing the cut-off point. Therefore, the correct answer is the one related to the increase in the number of true negatives among all negative test results when the cut-off point is lowered.

The answer is D) Negative predictive value.",D,True

"A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen. She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?","{'A': 'DIP has fewer neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP', 'B': 'DIP has fewer neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP', 'C': 'DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP', 'D': 'DIP has more neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP', 'E': 'DIP and PIP have similar numbers of neutrophils and monocytes'}",C,"The patient's symptoms suggest that she has inflammation in her DIP joints and PIP joints. The inflammation in the DIP joints is likely due to the recent laceration, while the pain in the PIP joints and MCP joints that worsens in the morning and improves over the day suggests a chronic inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, there is typically an increase in inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, in the affected joints.

Comparing the DIP joints (which are affected acutely) to the PIP joints (which are affected chronically in a condition like rheumatoid arthritis), we would expect the acute inflammation in the DIP joints to have a higher number of neutrophils and monocytes. However, since the question asks about the relative numbers of neutrophils and monocytes, we cannot definitively say which will be higher without specific data.

Given that the DIP joints are acute and the PIP joints are chronic, we can infer that there may be a shift in the cellular composition, with possibly more monocytes in the chronic inflammation of the PIP joints. However, without specific cell count data, we cannot confidently choose an answer based on the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes.

Therefore, the most appropriate option based on the information provided is:

E. DIP and PIP have similar numbers of neutrophils and monocytes

This choice reflects the understanding that the DIP joints are currently inflamed due to the laceration, while the PIP joints show signs of chronic inflammation, but without specific cell count data, we cannot determine if there is a significant difference in the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes between the two joint types.",D,False
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago.

He also reports occasional fatigue and unexplained weight gain. His past medical history is notable for gout, and he has a family history of medullary thyroid cancer. On examination, the thyroid is described as firm, symmetric, and stone-firm.

Given the family history of medullary thyroid cancer, one might consider a genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer. However, medullary thyroid cancer is associated with the RET proto-oncogene mutation and typically presents with a firm, symmetric goiter. The description of the thyroid as ""stone-firm"" suggests a more aggressive thyroid pathology.

The options provided are characteristic of different thyroid pathologies:

A. Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles - This is characteristic of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroid disorder that typically presents with a painless, enlarged thyroid and may be associated with hypothyroidism.

B. Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate - This is characteristic of subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, which usually presents with a painful thyroid gland and is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection.

C. Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions - This is characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, which often presents with a painless thyroid nodule.

D. Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis - This is characteristic of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer that typically presents in older adults with a rapidly enlarging neck mass.

E. Stromal amyloid deposition - This is characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with amyloid deposition and can be familial.

The lack of upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms makes an infectious cause less likely. The recent introduction of a new food (Lebanese restaurant) could be significant, but the fact that the patient predominantly eats fast food suggests that this may not be the primary cause. The patient's poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and recent start of glipizide could be related to the symptoms, but given the history of similar episodes since birth, it is less likely that the medication is the primary cause.

Considering all the information, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an idiopathic condition, meaning the cause is unknown. However, given the patient's African-American ethnicity and the recurrent nature of the episodes, a condition such as sickle cell disease could be considered. Sickle cell disease can cause episodes of dark urine due to hemoglobinuria and is more common in African-American populations.

The fact that he has type 2 diabetes mellitus and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years further increases his risk for cardiovascular disease. The ECG findings will be critical in determining the underlying cause, but since the actual ECG image is not provided, we must rely on the clinical presentation. Given the acute onset of symptoms and the risk factors present, an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is a likely consideration. Acute myocardial infarctions often present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and can lead to hypotension and paleness (due to poor perfusion) and diaphoresis (sweating). While a saddle pulmonary embolus can also present with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, the presence of chest pain and risk factors for coronary artery disease make myocardial infarction more likely. Viral myocarditis and acute pericarditis are less likely given the acute presentation and risk factors. Second-degree AV block could cause dizziness and lightheadedness but is less likely to cause the acute chest pain and diaphoresis seen in this patient.

"A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2–3 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2–3 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?","{'A': 'Trial of diphenhydramine', 'B': 'Complete caffeine cessation', 'C': 'Stop evening exercise', 'D': 'Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime', 'E': 'Scheduled afternoon naps'}",C,"The patient is experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep at night, and excessive drowsiness in the morning, despite going to bed at a reasonable time. He has tried various strategies such as taking melatonin and exercising before bedtime without success. He also mentions drinking three to five beers on weekends.

Option A, a trial of diphenhydramine, is not the most appropriate recommendation as this medication is an antihistamine with sedative properties and is not typically used for long-term management of insomnia.

Option B, complete caffeine cessation, is a reasonable recommendation since caffeine is a stimulant that can interfere with the ability to fall asleep and can contribute to daytime fatigue due to disrupted sleep patterns.

Option C, stopping evening exercise, is not the most appropriate recommendation as exercise is generally beneficial for sleep and should be encouraged, especially if it is helping the patient to fall asleep.

Option D, an alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime, is not appropriate as alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and exacerbate insomnia.

Option E, scheduled afternoon naps, is not the most appropriate recommendation as napping can interfere with nighttime sleep consolidation and may contribute to difficulty falling asleep at night.

Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation for this patient is to stop consuming caffeine, as it is a known stimulant that can interfere with sleep quality and may be contributing to his daytime fatigue and difficulty falling asleep at night.

The answer is B) Complete caffeine cessation.",A,False
A 53-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up appointment three days after being prescribed a selective alpha-1 agonist.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'B': 'Blastomycosis', 'C': 'Sporotrichosis', 'D': 'Histoplasmosis', 'E': 'Onychomycosis'}",D,"The patient's symptoms, including a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after a cold, along with the findings of a cavitary lesion in the right lung on chest X-ray and CT, suggest a pulmonary infection. The lung biopsy showing necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages is indicative of a fungal infection. Considering the patient's travel history to St. Louis, Missouri, which is an area endemic for Histoplasma capsulatum, the most likely diagnosis is Histoplasmosis. Therefore, the answer is D) Histoplasmosis.",D,True
"A 56-year-old man of Korean descent visits his primary care provider for an annual health check-up. His personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle. He has type-2 diabetes mellitus which is under control with oral medications. Upon physical examination, he is found to have a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, a pulse of 72/min, a respiratory rate of 18/min, and a body temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). The rest of the examination is unremarkable except for an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. In addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy, which of the following tests should also be included in further assessment of this patient?","{'A': 'Chest radiograph', 'B': 'Upper gastointestinal endoscopy', 'C': 'Computed tomography of head and neck', 'D': 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain', 'E': 'Ultrasound of the neck'}",B,"The patient has an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. This finding is concerning for a possible malignancy, such as lymphoma or metastatic carcinoma. In addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy, which is the gold standard for diagnosis, imaging studies can be helpful in staging the disease and determining the extent of the disease.

Option A, a chest radiograph, is useful to evaluate for any mediastinal masses or lung involvement, which can be seen in certain types of lymphoma or other malignancies.

Option B, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, is not indicated in this scenario as there are no symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal pathology.

Option C, computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck, can provide detailed images of the neck and thorax, but it is not the most appropriate initial imaging study for an enlarged supraclavicular node.

Option D, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, is not indicated as there are no neurological symptoms or signs that would suggest central nervous system involvement.

Option E, ultrasound of the neck, is a non-invasive and readily available imaging modality that can be used to evaluate the characteristics of the supraclavicular node and assess for any additional lymphadenopathy in the neck.

Given the clinical context, the most appropriate imaging study to include in the further assessment of this patient would be an ultrasound of the neck to evaluate the characteristics of the enlarged supraclavicular node and to search for additional lymphadenopathy. Therefore, the answer is E) Ultrasound of the neck.",A,False
"An 11-year-old boy was brought in by his mother with red tender bumps on his legs. The patient’s mother says that his symptoms started 3 days ago with a low-grade fever, malaise, and joint pain. He began to improve over the next 2 days, but this morning, when he woke up, she noticed multiple painful red bumps on his shins. Past medical history is significant for a recent severe sore throat and fever 1 week ago which resolved without treatment. The vital signs include: temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, pulse 85/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. Physical examination reveals multiple, firm and tender erythematous nodules with indistinct borders, averaging 4 cm in diameter. Lesions are localized to the anterior surface of the lower legs.

The most appropriate test for this purpose would be a throat culture to identify the presence of Group A Streptococcus. Therefore, the answer is A) Throat culture.",A,True
"A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?","{'A': 'Ammonium chloride', 'B': 'Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid', 'C': 'Mannitol', 'D': 'Sodium bicarbonate', 'E': 'Thiazide diuretics'}",D,"The patient's presentation with somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus, in the context of his medication history, suggests that he may have ingested his grandson's antiepileptic drugs, which could include phenytoin, valproate, or carbamazepine. These medications can cause the symptoms described, and their metabolism can be affected by warfarin. The concern about the international normalized ratio (INR) trending down suggests that the patient may have ingested a substance that acts as a vitamin K antagonist, thereby potentiating the effect of warfarin and leading to an increased risk of bleeding.

The most appropriate treatment to improve the urinary excretion of phenytoin, valproate, or carbamazepine would be:

C. Mannitol - Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can increase the renal clearance of various substances by promoting their tubular secretion and reducing their reabsorption. It is often used to enhance the elimination of toxic substances in cases of overdose.

These findings are suggestive of septic arthritis, a joint infection. In septic arthritis, the synovial fluid analysis typically shows a high white blood cell (WBC) count with a predominance of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, low viscosity due to the inflammatory process, and possibly decreased glucose and increased protein concentration.

Let's analyze the options:

A. WBC/mm3 1,600; % PMN > 25%; Viscosity N: This option suggests a mildly elevated WBC count with a high percentage of PMNs, but the viscosity is not consistent with an inflammatory process.

B. WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low: This option shows a markedly elevated WBC count with a very high percentage of PMNs and low viscosity, which is consistent with septic arthritis.

C. WBC/mm3 160; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity high: This option suggests a normal or slightly elevated WBC count with a low percentage of PMNs and high viscosity, which is not typical for septic arthritis.

D. WBC/mm3 2,400; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity low: This option shows a slightly elevated WBC count with a low percentage of PMNs and low viscosity, which is not typical for septic arthritis.

E. WBC/mm3 45,000; % PMN > 50%; Viscosity N: This option shows a very high WBC count with a high percentage of PMNs, but the viscosity is not low, which is not typical for septic arthritis.

Based on the clinical presentation and typical synovial fluid findings of septic arthritis, the most likely analysis would be a high WBC count with a predominance of PMNs and low viscosity. Therefore, the correct answer is B) WBC/",B,True

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","{'A': 'Diverticulitis', 'B': 'Hypothyroidism', 'C': 'Adenocarcinoma of the colon', 'D': 'Chronic inflammatory bowel disease', 'E': 'Irritable bowel syndrome'}",A,"The patient is a 68-year-old woman presenting with left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation, mild chronic constipation, and no significant weight change or urinary symptoms. Her last menstrual period was 16 years ago, indicating she is postmenopausal. The physical examination reveals tenderness in the left lower quadrant. The laboratory studies show an elevated leukocyte count of 16,000/mm³ with a predominance of neutrophils (89%), suggesting an acute inflammatory process.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is diverticulitis (A). Diverticulitis typically presents with left lower quadrant pain, tenderness, and fever, and it is more common in older adults. The elevated leukocyte count supports the presence of an inflammatory process. Hypothyroidism (B) can cause constipation but is less likely to present with localized left lower quadrant pain and fever. Adenocarcinoma of the colon (C) may present with changes in bowel habits and weight loss, but the acute presentation with fever and leukocytosis is less typical. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (D) could present with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain, but the patient's symptoms are more localized and acute. Irritable bowel syndrome (E) is a chronic functional disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits, but it does not cause fever or leukocytosis.

Therefore, the answer is A) Diverticulitis.",A,True
An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain.

"A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'Acute stress disorder', 'B': 'Performance anxiety', 'C': 'Schizophrenia', 'D': 'Posttraumatic stress disorder', 'E': 'Panic attack'}",D,"The patient's symptoms include upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. He also experiences intense fear of loud noises and sees sudden flashbacks to traumatic events experienced during his time in Iraq. These symptoms have caused significant distress and impairment in his social and occupational functioning, leading to him taking a leave from his army instructor duties and reluctance to leave his house. The duration of these symptoms is 7 weeks.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by the presence of intrusive symptoms (e.g., flashbacks, distressing dreams), avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event (e.g., reluctance to leave the house, avoidance of practice shooting ranges), negative alterations in cognition and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity (e.g., intense fear of loud noises) following exposure to a traumatic event. Symptoms must last for more than one month and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning.

Therefore, the answer is D) Posttraumatic stress disorder.",D,True
"A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 4-day history of left leg pain. Over the weekend, he scraped his left thigh when he fell on a muddy field while playing flag football with some friends. Since that time, he has had progressively worsening redness and pain in his left thigh. Past medical history is unremarkable. His temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for a poorly-demarcated area of redness on his left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape. This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions?","{'A': 'Bacterial endocarditis', 'B': 'Bacterial pneumonia', 'C': 'Bacterial sinusitis', 'D': 'Food-borne illness', 'E': 'Urinary tract infection'}",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, which is a severe, rapidly progressing infection of the soft tissue with secondary necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue. The presence of free air in the soft tissue on CT scan suggests that the infection has caused gas formation, which is a characteristic of gas-forming bacteria. The most common organisms responsible for necrotizing fasciitis are Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus. Among these, Streptococcus pyogenes is known to cause bacterial endocarditis, which is a condition where the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves become infected. Therefore, the answer is A) Bacterial endocarditis.",A,False
"A 75-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 30 minutes of slurred speech and arm weakness. On the drive over to the hospital, her symptoms have resolved completely. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, morbid obesity, gout, and vascular claudication. Her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/111 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the patient's upper and lower extremities. The patient's memory is intact and her speech seems normal and fluent. Her gait is stable with no ataxia. An initial head CT demonstrates diffuse atrophy which is consistent with previous head CT scans. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","{'A': 'Alteplase', 'B': 'CT angiogram', 'C': 'Echocardiogram', 'D': 'Heparin', 'E': 'MRI'}",B,"The patient presents with transient symptoms of slurred speech and arm weakness that have resolved completely. Given her past medical history of atrial fibrillation, she is at risk for an embolic stroke. However, her symptoms have resolved, and her physical exam is normal, including cranial nerves, strength, sensation, speech, and gait. The head CT shows diffuse atrophy but no acute abnormalities. The absence of acute findings on the head CT makes alteplase (tPA) unlikely to be beneficial and potentially harmful due to the risk of hemorrhage. A CT angiogram is typically used to evaluate for vascular abnormalities such as aneurysms or stenosis but is not indicated in this case without evidence of focal neurological deficits or other indications. An echocardiogram could be useful to evaluate for sources of emboli, such as a cardiac source, but it is not the immediate next step in management. Heparin could be considered if there was a high suspicion for a thromboembolic event, but again, the transient nature of symptoms and normal physical exam make this less likely. An MRI would be more sensitive than a CT for detecting ischemic changes and could identify small or subtle infarcts that were not visible on the CT. Given the transient nature of symptoms and the need for further evaluation of the cerebral vasculature and potential for ischemic stroke, the best next step in management would be an MRI. Therefore, the answer is E) MRI.",E,False
"A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?","{'A': 'Rapidly progresive glomerulonephritis', 'B': 'Amyloidosis', 'C': 'Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis', 'D': 'Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis', 'E': 'Minimal change disease'}",E,"The patient's presentation with fevers, chills, night sweats, and a lymph node biopsy suggests a systemic disease that could be related to a hematologic or immunologic disorder. The finding of 4+ protein in his urine indicates significant proteinuria, which can be associated with various renal pathologies.

Among the options provided, rapidly proliferative glomerulonephritis (A) is often associated with systemic diseases such as lupus nephritis or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Amyloidosis (B) can cause nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (C) is a cause of nephrotic syndrome and can be associated with immune complex deposition. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (D) is also a cause of nephrotic syndrome and can be primary or secondary to other conditions. Minimal change disease (E) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, particularly in children, but less likely in this case given the patient's systemic symptoms and lymph node biopsy.

Given the systemic symptoms and the lymph node biopsy, which suggests a systemic disease, the most likely renal pathology would be one associated with systemic disease. Amyloidosis (B) is a condition that can cause both systemic symptoms and significant proteinuria due to the deposition of amyloid proteins in various organs, including the kidneys. Therefore, the answer is B) Amyloidosis.",B,False
"A 12-year-old girl is brought to your psychiatry office by her parents, who are concerned that she has not made any friends since starting middle school last year. The girl tells you that she gets nervous around other children, as she cannot tell what they are feeling, when they are joking, or what she has in common with them. Her teachers describe her as “easily distracted” and “easily upset by change.” When asked about her hobbies and interests, she states that “marine biology” is her only interest and gives you a 15-minute unsolicited explanation of how to identify different penguin species. Mental status exam is notable for intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process. Which of the following is true regarding this child’s disorder?","{'A': 'Boys are more commonly affected than girls', 'B': 'Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder', 'C': 'Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder', 'D': 'It is usually associated with a family history of schizophrenia', 'E': 'Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age'}",A,"The girl's symptoms suggest that she may have a disorder on the autism spectrum. This is supported by her difficulty with social interactions, her intense focus on a specific interest (marine biology and penguins), and her lack of friends since starting middle school. The mental status exam findings of intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Let's evaluate the options:

A. Boys are more commonly affected than girls: This is not true for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In fact, ASD is more common in boys, but the gender distribution is not as pronounced as in some other disorders.

B. Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder: While individuals with ASD may have difficulties with attention, it is not the defining feature of the disorder.

C. Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder: Intellectual disability can be associated with ASD, but it is not a necessary feature. Many individuals with ASD have normal intelligence.

D. It is usually associated with a family history of schizophrenia: There is no strong evidence to suggest that ASD is usually associated with a family history of schizophrenia.

E. Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age: The symptoms of ASD typically become apparent by the age of 3-5 years, which aligns with the girl's age.

Based on the information provided, the most accurate statement regarding this child's disorder is that the typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age. Therefore, the answer is E) Typical age of onset is 3-5 years.",E,False

The mainstay of treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. Gluten is found in wheat, barley, and rye. The symptoms of severe diarrhea and bloating are likely due to malabsorption in the damaged small intestine.

Option A, avoiding all dairy products, is not the most appropriate recommendation as lactose intolerance is common in celiac disease but not all dairy products are strictly off-limits for patients with celiac disease. Some dairy products are gluten-free.

Option B, Diphenoxylate, is an anti-diarrheal medication that can provide temporary relief from diarrhea.

Option C, empirical therapy with metronidazole, is not indicated as there is no history of recent travel or other symptoms suggestive of an infectious etiology.

Option D, prednisone, is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat refractory celiac disease but is not typically used for the temporary control of symptoms.

Option E, restriction of soy products, is not necessary for all patients with celiac disease as soy can be a gluten-free option.

Given the options, the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating would be an anti-diarrheal medication.

Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?","{'A': 'Diffuse alveolar damage', 'B': 'Ventricular septal defect', 'C': 'Myocardial free wall rupture', 'D': 'Papillary muscle rupture', 'E': 'Myocardial reinfarction'}",A,"The patient experienced an acute drop in blood pressure during surgery with ST elevations in multiple leads, which resolved with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions.

The presence of crackles on auscultation and the low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 5 mm Hg suggest that the patient may have developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to diffuse alveolar damage from the trauma and the subsequent inflammatory response. The other options are less likely given the clinical scenario and the chest x-ray findings (which are not provided in the question). Therefore, the answer is A) Diffuse alveolar damage.",A,True
"A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?","{'A': 'Exotoxin release', 'B': 'Antigenic variation', 'C': 'Polysaccharide capsule', 'D': ""Bruton's agammaglobulinemia"", 'E': 'Lack of necessary vaccination'}",B,"The patient's infection is caused by gram-negative diplococci, which is characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This bacterium is known for its ability to evade the host immune response through antigenic variation. It frequently changes its surface proteins, specifically the pilus proteins, to escape recognition by the host immune system. This mechanism explains the lack of lasting immunity in the patient. The answer is B) Antigenic variation.",B,True
"A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic with easy fatigability and breathlessness when climbing stairs for the last 2 weeks. He also mentions that he occasionally has bouts of cough at night after about 2–3 hours of sleep which is relieved when he sits upright. He denies shortness of breath at rest, palpitations, and loss of consciousness. He has had hypertension for the last 20 years and is on antihypertensive medications. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Chest auscultation reveals crackles over the lung bases bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen reveals mildly tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigation results include a hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL (9.18 mmol/L) and an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide. His two-dimensional echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following novel drugs is most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan?","{'A': 'Etanercept', 'B': 'Ivabradine', 'C': 'Moxonidine', 'D': 'Sacubitril', 'E': 'Aliskiren'}",D,"The patient's symptoms of easy fatigability, breathlessness on exertion, cough at night relieved by sitting up, and the presence of crackles over the lung bases bilaterally are suggestive of heart failure. The elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide and the echocardiogram findings of an enlarged left atrium with a preserved ejection fraction (55%) further support this diagnosis. The patient is already on an antihypertensive medication (valsartan).

Among the options provided, ivabradine (B) is a drug that can be beneficial in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It works by reducing the heart rate without affecting blood pressure or ventricular contractility, thus improving symptoms and reducing hospitalizations.

Etanercept (A) is a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor used in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and is not indicated for heart failure. Moxonidine (C) is an antihypertensive agent that has been withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns. Sacubitril (D) is a neprilysin inhibitor that is used in combination with valsartan (as sacubitril/valsartan) for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), not for HFpEF. Aliskiren (E) is a direct renin inhibitor used for hypertension and is not indicated for heart failure.

Therefore, the answer is B) Ivabradine.",B,False
"A 32-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision at high speed. The patient was found unconscious by the paramedics and regained consciousness briefly during the ambulance ride. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient’s vitals show: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 12/min, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals an unresponsive man with multiple bruises across the chest and along the upper arms with a laceration on the forehead. His is unresponsive to verbal commands and physical touch. His GCS is 6/15. The right pupil is fixed and dilated. An urgent noncontrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the image. The patient is prepared for emergency neurosurgery. Which of the following anesthesia medications would be the best option for this patient?","{'A': 'Propofol', 'B': 'Halothane', 'C': 'Midazolam', 'D': 'Nitrous oxide', 'E': 'Sevoflurane'}",A,"The patient has a head injury with a fixed and dilated pupil, which is indicative of increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation. In such cases, it is important to avoid medications that can increase cerebral blood flow or intracranial pressure. Nitrous oxide, for example, can potentially expand trapped air in the cranial cavity and worsen herniation. Therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with suspected brain herniation. Propofol, on the other hand, is a hypnotic agent that provides rapid onset and has minimal cerebral vasodilatory effects, making it a good choice for anesthesia in patients with head trauma. Halothane and sevoflurane are inhalational anesthetics that can cause cerebral vasodilation and increase intracranial pressure, making them less suitable for this patient. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that can be used for sedation but does not provide the necessary anesthesia for neurosurgical procedures. Considering the need for anesthesia for emergency neurosurgery and the patient's condition, propofol would be the best option. Therefore, the answer is A) Propofol.",A,True
"A 20-year-old woman presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition for the past 5 days. She is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. The patient denies any fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain. She is afebrile and the vital signs are within normal limits.

"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?","{'A': 'Measurement bias', 'B': 'Recall bias', 'C': 'Lead-time bias', 'D': 'Selection bias', 'E': 'Length-time bias'}",A,The correct answer is C) Lead-time bias.,C,False
"A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department for evaluation of hemoptysis. A chest X-ray reveals bilateral focal pulmonary consolidation. On further questioning, he admits having hematuria. Urinalysis shows RBC casts and 400 mL of urine is excreted in 24 hours. What is the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient?","{'A': 'Anti-Smith antibodies', 'B': 'Anti-neutrophil antibodies', 'C': 'Anti-mitochondrial antibodies', 'D': 'Anti-nuclear antibodies', 'E': 'Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies'}",E,"The patient's presentation of hemoptysis and hematuria, along with the finding of RBC casts in the urine, is suggestive of a renal pathology. The presence of RBC casts typically indicates glomerulonephritis. Among the options provided, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are associated with Goodpasture's syndrome, which can present with both pulmonary and renal involvement, including hemoptysis and hematuria. Therefore, the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient is anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. The answer is E) Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies.",E,True
"A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 59 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?","{'A': 'Ceftriaxone', 'B': 'Dextrose', 'C': 'Lactulose', 'D': 'Potassium', 'E': 'Rifaximin'}",D,"The patient presents with altered mental status, a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism, and worsening confusion. The presence of asterixis and a distended abdomen suggests hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with liver dysfunction, and it is often precipitated by electrolyte imbalances, infections, or the use of certain medications.

The laboratory values provided do not show significant electrolyte imbalances that would explain his confusion (e.g., normal sodium, potassium, and calcium levels). His blood glucose is low, which could contribute to confusion, but it is not severely low and would not typically cause asterixis.

The best next treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is lactulose, which is a non-absorbable disaccharide that works by acidifying the contents of the bowel, converting ammonia to ammonium, and promoting its excretion. Lactulose also acts as an osmotic laxative to help evacuate the bowels of nitrogenous waste.

Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic that may be used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy if there is suspicion of bacterial infection, but there is no fever or other signs of infection in this patient.

Dextrose would be used to treat hypoglycemia, but the patient's glucose level is not low enough to warrant its use.

Potassium supplementation is not indicated as the patient's potassium level is within the normal range.

Rifaximin is another antibiotic that can be used to reduce the production of ammonia by intestinal bacteria, but it is typically used after lactulose has been initiated.

Therefore, the best next treatment for this patient, based on the information provided, is lactulose. 

The answer is C) Lactulose.",C,False
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for incomprehensible speech. Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained.
