5,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside of the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. When plaque builds up in the arteries, it narrows them, reducing blood flow to your heart. This can lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack, and other complications. There are several risk factors for CAD. Some of the risk factors you cannot change, such as your age, sex, and family history. However, there are many risk factors that you can change or manage. These include: 1. High blood pressure: High blood pressure can damage your artery walls, allowing plaque to build up more quickly. 2. High cholesterol levels: High levels of cholesterol in your blood can lead to the formation of plaques in your arteries. 3. Diabetes: Having diabetes doubles your risk of developing CAD. 4. Smoking: Smoking damages your blood vessels and speeds up the process of plaque buildup. 5. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases your risk of CAD and other heart diseases. 6. Physical inactivity: Lack of exercise can lead to weight gain, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, which are all risk factors for CAD. 7. Unhealthy diet: A diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol can increase your risk of CAD. 8. Stress: Chronic stress may contribute to the development of CAD. It is important to know your risk factors for CAD. If you have risk factors that you cannot change, such as your age or family history, it is even more important to manage the risk factors that you can. Making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, and managing other health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, can help reduce your risk of developing CAD.","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition where plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries, which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Several factors increase the likelihood of developing CAD: 1. Age: The risk of CAD increases with age. Men over 45 years and women over 55 years have a higher risk. 2. Family history: Having a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, with a history of CAD increases the risk. 3. Gender: Men are generally at a higher risk of developing CAD than premenopausal women. However, after menopause, the risk for women increases and becomes similar to that of men. 4. Smoking: Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that can damage the inner lining of the arteries, leading to plaque formation. Smokers are at a higher risk of developing CAD. 5. High blood pressure: High blood pressure puts extra strain on the heart and arteries, increasing the risk of CAD. 6. High cholesterol levels: Elevated levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, along with low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. 7. Diabetes: People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing CAD. 8. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of CAD. 9. Sedentary lifestyle: Lack of regular physical activity is associated with a higher risk of CAD. 10. Stress: Chronic stress may contribute to the development of CAD by causing changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and blood clotting. It's important to note that having these risk factors doesn't necessarily mean someone will develop CAD.
